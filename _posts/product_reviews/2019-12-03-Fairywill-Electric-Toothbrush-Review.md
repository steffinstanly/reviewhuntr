No matter how old we are, visiting the dentist is never a fun thought for any of us. After all, who wants the cold metal devices to poke around their mouth and clang against their teeth? Absolutely no one!



Yet, this avoidance causes us to go to the dentist eventually anyway, which is mostly due to dental emergencies. These issues include but are not limited to tooth infections, cavities, as well as plaque and tartar - which can all be avoided easily if only we take care of our teeth daily.

 
This poses yet another problem, since cleaning our teeth seems like such a tedious task. It is so boring and cumbersome at times during the busy days that no one likes to do it. In addition to that, even if we get into the habit of regular cleaning, we often have to visit the dentist due to the home practices not being enough for optimal hygiene.

That’s where the {{ link }} comes in.


As a powerful and electric toothbrush that’s built to resolve the issues mentioned above, the {{ link }} promises to deliver dentist like cleaning right at your home. It also saves you from paying a fortune to the dentist and lets you benefit from optimal hygiene at home with its powerful mechanism.


Due to its automated power, the {{ link }} claims to remove 100 percent more stains than a manual toothbrush. This is possible through the 40,000 micro-brushes per minute that the toothbrush produces like a charm. Made out of dupont nylon, the bristles reach even the most difficult nooks and crannies of your teeth and gums in order to provide you with a thoroughly cleaned mouth.

  

With its 5 high-performance brushing modes including White, Clean, Sensitive, Polish, and Massage Brushing, the {{ link }} claims to provide you with cleaner and healthier teeth in 7 days. But it doesn’t stop there. It also promises to improve your overall oral health and allows your gums to be healthier within 14 days of use.

  

Fairywill has built the toothbrush with performance being front and center. That is the reason why it has such confidence in its toothbrush. With each toothbrush coming with not one, not two, but three different brush heads, the company focuses on the brush being the perfect fit for every dental structure. In order to up the ante in delivering a dentist level cleaning experience, the Fairywill is also waterproof. It also comes with a self-timer that gives you 2 minutes of timed cleaning with 30-second intervals - just like the dentist’s office.

The {{ link }} is built with a sleek and modern design, with all 5 modes of cleaning being indicated by the panel on the front. It also comes with a power button in the middle, which lets you use the brush with just the press of a single button. Sporting just 55 grams in weight, the brush is easy to hold and doesn’t weigh you down during its 2 minutes of powerful cleaning everyday. To add to its overall features, the brush comes with a reduced noise. The brush is made out of ABS/TPE and comes in a black color.
  

The {{ sn-link }} is rechargeable and claims to provide 30 days of cleaning against a single 4-hour charge. With the ability to recharge through a USB cable and auto-shutoff after a full charge, it is also travel-friendly and fuss-free for those who do not want to put up with the hassle of traditional electric toothbrushes. To add to the ease of use, the brush heads also come with blue indicator bristles that remind you when it’s time to replace the brush head.

  

Coming to real world usage, those who have utilized the brush swear by its functions. According to users, the 5-function cleaning really does its intended job and delivers visibly cleaner teeth and healthier gums within a couple of weeks. Users have also noted that they no longer have to be worried about being too tired to brush at night, since the electric toothbrush’s lighter weight, anti-slip handle and automated timer makes it seem like you are getting your teeth brushed by the dentist every day, minus the fear that you might feel at the visit to one’s office.

  

Users have also noted that the dupont nylon bristles are a great touch in the brush’s price point since they allow for optimal cleaning while also going easy on the teeth and gums with their soft surface. At the same time, the bristles are sturdy enough to withstand 40,000 micro-brushes per minute, striking the perfect balance between cleanliness and comfort. Users have noted that this makes the electric toothbrush an ideal device for everyday usage.

  

A very limited number of users have taken an issue with a tingling sensation in their mouth immediately after using the {{ link }}. But the company already clarifies that the tingling sensation is normal for the first couple of weeks, during which you should be using the Sensitive mode. Once your mouth is used to the {{ link }} or if you already have healthy gums, you can switch to other modes accordingly. A majority of users stands by this statement and maintains that they find no problems with the electric toothbrush at all.

  

At $29.95, the {{ link }} is available at Amazon and comes with a 1-year warranty directly from the manufacturer.

  

## Conclusion

All in all, the {{ link }} is an easy to use and highly functional cleaning device that lets you maintain optimal oral hygiene with minimal efforts. With its user-friendly yet sleek design and simple yet modern functions, it can be a perfect fit for every member of your family.
