In today’s fast-paced world, what’s the one thing that everyone needs a lot of and gets very little of? If your answer is the ever-elusive sleep, then you are not alone. It seems like everyone is running after a much-deserved rest. We all seek it at the end of the day, only to get rewarded with hours of being awake.


It’s all too common of an occurrence: After hours of work, studies, and a general sense of hard work, sleep remains miles away in the night no matter how hard you try to relax. But then, sleepiness strikes you at very inopportune moments throughout your day. You could be in a meeting, over a phone call, or in an important class - and boom… there comes the sudden burst of sleep that causes you to doze off in the middle of whatever you are doing.

It is not only embarrassing to have a sudden jolt of sleep in a public place, but it can also be very unprofessional. Even more so, it can be detrimental to how those around you perceive you as a person. If you demonstrate a sleepy demeanor throughout your day when you are supposed to be active and alert, people stop taking you seriously, your opinions are brushed off easily, and you are left with a tarnished reputation that accounts you as being lazy even if you are awake 20 hours a day. That’s why it is important that you do something about your restless nights before they turn into a bigger problem.

Thankfully, these solutions can be easy to implement when they come in the form of a product such as the {{ link }}.

The {{ link }} promises to make you feel relaxed as soon as you make your way to bed. As the name suggests, the mattress comes fully equipped with the comfort of memory foam as well as the durability of inner springs. Together, this hybrid mechanism provides you with a firm yet relaxing mattress to lay on. No matter how stressed out you are, the mattress promises to make you feel comfortable to the point where falling asleep no longer seems like a daunting task. Thanks to the way that it’s built, it also helps you stay asleep during the night. This means no more tossing and turning over an uncomfortable mattress in the dead of the night. Most users sing praises of the sleep quality that this mattress offers to them each night, which is by far the most important and best feature of the mattress.

  
The {{ sn-link }} delivers this mix of comfort and reliability through its state of the art construction. Its memory foam is sewn right into its knit cover to provide ample support and targeted cushioning to anyone who rests on the mattress. At the same time, the innerspring under a few more layers of comfort foam brings the firmness that most people need to have a good night’s sleep. The springs are 6 inches in height and made of high-quality material to give the memory foam ample support to function optimally. Users have noted that using this hybrid mattress has given them the kind of comfort they needed without costing them a fortune.

  

This 10-inch version of the mattress has a medium firmness feel to it, which makes sure that you don’t feel like you are sinking into the mattress while still enjoying the softness that it brings to the table. Since the memory foam can adjust itself to your spine position and weight, you can rest assured that you are not going to wake up feeling stiff or sore. Instead, the mattress will deliver the kind of sleep that leaves you with a relaxed and rested feeling every morning, day after day. Users have noted that the overall feel of this 10-inch version provided them with the balance they needed between the softness and firmness of their mattress. According to most users, the mattress helped them with their back pain and provided them with great value for money.

  

With that being said, a few users have mentioned that the hybrid mattress are not as strong and comfortable. Even fewer have mentioned that they noticed bed bugs in their mattress. But this is in stark contrast to the positive reviews that a vast majority of the users hold for the mattress. Some users have gone on record to refute the bed bug complaints, mentioning that they noticed only specks of dust on the plastic packaging and not bed bugs at all.

  
The {{ sn-link }} comes in different sizes, including twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king. You can opt to receive a platform bed frame for additional cost. But it is not mandatory if you already have a bedframe at home to put the mattress on. The mattress is also delivered pressed and rolled, which makes it easy to carry it through your home until you have settled it on your bed. Users have noted that this makes it very easy to set up their new bed.

  

The queen size, 10-inch hybrid mattress is currently available at a discounted price of just over $213, slashing about 15% of its list price of $249.99.
