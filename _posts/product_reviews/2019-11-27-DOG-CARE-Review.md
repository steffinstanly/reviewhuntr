If you have a heart that feels anything at all, then it is safe to say that you love dogs just as much as the next person. Yes, the statement is very generalized. But if you are the proud parent of a dog, you will undoubtedly identify with this ride or die approach that comes with loving these balls of love, loyalty and ultimate joy.


But sometimes, these furballs can pose some barking and noise issues that can disturb people around them. Whether it’s your neighbor, your actual human baby, or someone in your family who is going through a medical ailment, these loud barks can be quite disturbing to select people in your life. Thankfully, with some modern dog training methods, you can have your dog get rid of these habits in a very safe yet effective way.

  

The {{ link }} is one such training device that helps your dog with their barking problem. {{ sn-link }} promises a humane training method that uses vibrations and light shocks to stop the barking of your noisy furballs. But all of this is done without being anything but gentle towards your dog’s care. With an adjustable strap size and comfortable built, the dog collar is fit for many breeds.

  

The {{ link }} works through an automatic bark detection system that identifies barking when it’s within 0.8 inches of its range, and only when it reaches the sound level of 113 db or over. This makes sure that even gentle shocks are not inflicted on your dog accidentally, and they don’t get confused about the training method when they were not barking at all. This method also ensures that the collar is not accidentally set off by a fellow dog barking nearby.

  




Since the shocks are designed to be very light and provide just a hint of distraction to your dog upon their barking, this collar remains a very humane and gentle method to train dogs with a noise problem. This way if you are not around for a large portion of the day or if you don’t have the time to train your dog actively, you can still address their noise problem to keep them safe from the complaints of your neighbors.

  
{{ sn-link }} ensures that you don’t even have to be professionally trained or have to watch YouTube videos to become a makeshift dog trainer. Instead, the company has built the {{ link }} in a way that it takes the responsibility of your dog’s training upon itself due to its automatic mechanism. The Bark Collar comes with 2 frequencies in vibration and shock mode, where the shock mode comes with 7 intensity levels. When your dog barks, the Bark Collar begins its work by first setting off the vibration, and then follows it up with the lowest frequency of shocks which it releases at detecting loud barks. If your dog does not react to the lowest setting, the collar increases the intensity frequently until your dog responds and stops barking.

  
But this method of progressive increase in shock intensity does not mean that your dog is being put under any inhumane strain. The Bark Collar resets itself if there is a 30-second interval between barks. This means that your dog will not receive the highest level of shock at barking after 30 seconds of their last shock.

  
The Bark Collar also comes with the assurance that if your dog does not stop barking even after activating all 7 shock levels, then the shocks stop so you can deal with your dog in your gentle way. This makes sure that your dog remains safe at all times even when you are not around. The Bark Collar comes with 5 levels of sensitivity, which makes sure that you can train your dog effectively. The collar also promises to understand your dog’s barking levels and style, so it can automatically understand which static level to set off for training.


The {{ link }} is battery powered, with two LR44 batteries lasting about 7 days. When the battery is about to deplete, the LED indicators are right there to inform you about it. The Bark Collar is also energy efficient in the way that it puts itself into standby mode automatically if it doesn’t detect any activity for a while. This ensures that your dog can be trained even when you take them with you on longer vacations, where you do not want to set off the bad side of the hotel staff or your Airbnb host by continuous barking sounds.

  

The {{ link }} has a very modern style with adjustable straps. At first glance, it looks like a device out of a science fiction movie where your dog can translate their speech through it. This attractive design of the Bark Collar makes sure that it looks good on your dog and doesn’t seem like a training device at all. With it, the adjustable straps also ensure that the collar remains comfortable for your dog. Specifically, the Bark Collar comes in fits that range from 8.8” to 20.8”.

  

Users have noted that the Bark Collar did effectively resolve the issue of their dog’s noise problem without affecting their wellbeing, playfulness or overall health. According to users, the Bark Collar is as easy to use as it claims to be, where all that they had to do was to put the collar on their dog. The Bark Collar took care of the rest and ensured it trained their dog humanely and effectively. Users have noted that this makes the Bark Collar very easy to use while also remaining very purposeful.

  

With that being said, very few users have noted that the Bark Collar did not work as intended. But other users have presented comments that are in complete contrast of this claim. Users have noted that the collar is built from durable material, and works exactly as they thought it would.

  

At $29.99, the {{ link }} is available for purchase from Amazon. Users have noted that the price point translates to great value for money.
