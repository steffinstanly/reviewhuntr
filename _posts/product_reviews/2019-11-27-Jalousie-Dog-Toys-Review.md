No matter how old we are, the very feel of taking care of our very own dog is enough to fill us with a warmth that remains unmatched by anything else in the world. That is why, from parents to kids, everyone loves having their furball to call their companion, their friend, and their beacon of their home.

As described by the product title itself, Jalousie promises to provide your dog with 12 toys within the package, all of which come with their squeaky sound. The 12 toys that are included within the item are all colorful, come in different shapes, and create a set of playful imagery that is going to be just as adorable for you to look at as it is enjoyable for your dog to play with.

  

The {{ sn-link }} also promise to be gentle on your pup’s teeth. Since the toys are made out of fabric and classify as plush toys, they provide a dental experience to your dogs which is healthy for their oral structure. The manufacturer, Jalousie, claims that the toys provide a dental cleaning, gum massage and jaw exercise without making your doggo fret about going to the vet. Of course, the added advantage of stress relief that is the actual purpose of many chew toys remains front and center within these toys as well.
  

The 12 toys that come in this offering are meant to be enjoyed by small to medium breeds. Jalousie promises that the toys are the right size for these breeds. This means that if your fur baby is a large dog, then you might have to look elsewhere for their play. But if your pup fits within the classification of a small or medium breed, then these toys can be a perfect fit for them.
  

Jalousie also claims that the toys are made out of premium quality material. With that, the company also promises that even the manufacturing is done with premium standards in mind. That is why the toys are all made by being sewn together and use no glue or any other toxic substance that could affect your dog’s health in the long term.

 

Coming to the appearance of the toys, you can get them in cute shapes that mostly have little faces of their own. From a smiling banana to a ducky milk bottle, and from a large strawberry to a delicious-looking doughnut, your dog can have a lot of fun with these shapes while you can have a smile on your face as you see them strewn around your living room. Of course, you will have to pick them now and then, but when the toys are this adorable, it makes that task a lot easier. The toys also come in different sizes, with the smallest mushroom one being 3 inches in height, and the largest ice cream cone one boasting a height of 9 inches. All other toys have different sizes and width.

Jalousie has also specifically mentioned that while the toys are well built, they are not meant to last forever, especially with dogs who are aggressive with their play. Since the outer material is fabric that covers a plush filling, this warning makes sense.
