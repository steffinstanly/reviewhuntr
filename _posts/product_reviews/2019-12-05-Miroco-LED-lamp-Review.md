With an absence of bright sunlight, noticeable darkness through the day, and increasing duration of the night, winter is anything but fun for anyone. Sure, we all have our hot chocolate and fireplaces to look forward to, but even they are not as effective when we naturally feel a sudden lack of motivation and an abrupt sense of sadness creeping in on us. The feeling often worsens the effects of existing mental illnesses and contributes to issues such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

As if that wasn’t enough, the decision to roll our clocks back an hour is the final straw for most of us to instantly feel a rush of winter blues. If you are in the same boat, then you will understand the feeling to a T. Most of us go through it every day, after all.

 
Coffee doesn’t help. Cat videos don’t do much. And TED Talks seem like mere words. But given that you just can’t hide under the cocoon of your blankets at home, you need to fulfill your responsibilities even during this difficult time.

 
Thankfully, you can turn to a therapy light to help you get back your mojo through your own personal sun, and be your original cheery self even through the onset of winter.
  

The Miroco LED Bright White Light Therapy Lamp promises to help alleviate the depressing and often crippling effects of SAD, the more intense onset of year-round depression, or noticeable symptoms of other mental disorders.


At its core, the {{ sn-link }} is exactly what its name suggests it to be. It is an LED lamp that produces a 10,000 Lux Brightness, resulting in a white, bright and warm light that can turn your mood for the better. It’s all due to how the light effectively emulates the effects of sunlight even when it is not bright or sunny outside due to seasonal changes. This elevates your mood, helps you feel energized, and helps you focus more on the tasks at hand.

  



Due to these effects, the {{ sn-link }} is a must-have for anyone who seems down and out with the onset of winter. Even when the sky is cloudier or the days are shorter, you will be able to withstand the depressing effects of the weather by simply turning to this wonderfully bright light that can be placed in any room of your choice. Thanks to its light therapy, you can count on this SAD lamp to kick away the winter blues in a very easy manner.


Apart from defeating the feeling of despair that comes with winter, the {{ sn-link }} also helps you restore a healthy sleeping schedule after a jet lag. This makes it a good fit for frequent flyers. At the same time, it can also help you adjust your body clock between hectic shift changes, which makes it an ideal gift for anyone who works in a field such as medicine or customer service.

  

The therapy lamp comes with 3 built-in modes that are activated through simple finger touch. This means that you don’t have to go through gruelling setup processes when you are at your lowest mood of the day. Simply select your preferred intensity of light, and the SAD lamp does the rest. At Light, Warm, or Bright, the lamp provides you with 3 brightness levels at a color temperature of 6,500K. The lamp comes with a user manual and a power adapter, which is all you need to set up the light.


You can also set automatic timers for the light, which range from 10-60 minutes. These timers can be set with 10-minute intervals. This ensures that you are using your therapy light efficiently and not wasting away the battery when you do not need the exposure to light as much. As a result, you can enjoy enhanced focus, increased energy, improved mood, and better sleep throughout your day. How ironically cool is that to find in colder months, where these things seem like nothing but a distant dream?



Apart from providing you with considerably better days to enjoy in winter, the {{ sn-link }} also boasts of a portable and lightweight design. The bracket of the light remains foldable, which makes the lamp very easy to carry around at its 15 ounces of weight. You can place the modern-looking light anywhere in your home or office, where it can fit with a variety of decor choices without looking out of place for even a second. With a detachable stand, you can place your lamp at your desk, at the counter, or even against the wall. The lamp’s dimensions of 6.3 x 1.57 x 7.87 inches make it easily noticeable without making it jarring.

  

Overall, the Miroco LED Bright White light serves as your very own private sun without making you feel guilty about hogging the sunlight from others. In fact, given the intensity of the light, you can share it with your family members, friends or coworkers without affecting your mood for the worse.

  

According to users, the Miroco LED Bright White light is extremely easy to use. All that they have to do is to plug its adapter and fix their desired level of brightness with a single touch. From there, it is all a matter of sitting at a comfortable distance from the light. That’s about it. The lamp does its magic from there without you having to do anything at all. The 58-inch cord of the adapter works wonders in helping you achieve this very easy task.

  

A majority of users has noted that the lamp works like a charm for their mood improvement during winter. At the same time, those who work with a difficult schedule or travel a lot also sing the praises of the lamp and its effectiveness. According to users, the lamp has helped them achieve their personal improvement goals with ease, where they have been able to benefit from increased energy and elevated mood even in the absence of the sun.

  

The {{ sn-link }} is so well-reviewed that it has only a handful of ratings over the web that are not 5-star glowing comments. This makes it one of the most well-reviewed products not only in its class but throughout general lighting devices. At the time of writing, the handful of reviewers that have given the light anything below 3-stars on Amazon claim that the lamp did not work as intended. Whereas, a whopping majority of users swears by the lamp and its effectiveness.

  

At $39.99, the {{ link }} is available at Amazon.
