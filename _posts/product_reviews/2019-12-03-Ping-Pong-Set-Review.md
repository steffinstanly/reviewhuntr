With new computer and mobile games releasing every other week and the latest gaming consoles on the way, those who want to get away from perpetual screen time find it difficult to do so. After all, who can leave the flashy world of bright lights and modern tech to go back to sports or indoor games for that matter?


But if you are serious about maintaining a balance between your screen time and interactive activity, then you can turn towards products and solutions that promise to resolve this issue in a very effective way. The {{ link }} is one such item that helps you break away from the screen while still letting you enjoy the wonders of technology.

The {{ link }} promises to take an old and beloved game and bring it to the future. With an especially designed base and two equally customized rackets, this modern spin on ping pong doesn’t require you to hit an actual ball during play. Instead, it allows you to play with a ball of light all by yourself or with another human player.


Sounds interesting? Then this product might just be for you.

  

The {{ link }} comes with infrared technology, which allows you to “hit” the virtual ball of light across your ceiling and between multiple players. This way, you can enjoy an immersive experience in a very modern setting, and with double the fun due to the mechanisms at play.


Since the {{ link }} can be played over any table, it eliminates the need to have a dedicated table tennis setup. This means that you can play it in any room in your home or office during your free time, without any worries of not having enough space. In fact, users have noted that the smaller the space they had, the better the {{ sn-link }} worked for them.

  

The actual base of the ping pong set is very stylishly designed in a circular shape that is risen like a bowl but has a flat surface and a hollow space in the middle from where the infrared light emits and does its magic. Labeled as the Base Dome by the manufacturer, this device also comes with two backlit LCD panels that help you see your score in real-time. With a white color, black accents and an overall modern built, the base dome carries every bit of the futuristic design that you expect from such a product.

  

Next come the rackets, which look like something right out of a space-age movie. With a thick handle that’s designed for optimal grip but a hollow frame on the racket head, each racket illuminates from its inner edges to project a futuristic image to the players and spectators alike. Whenever the ball of light “hits” the rackets, it bounces off of the ceiling and acts like a real ping pong ball whether you are taking it solo or challenging a friend or family member. Built with black and white material, both rackets are identical except for their LED light, which comes in blue and green shades.

  

The rules of the {{ link }} are also very well defined. The game comes with 3 difficulty levels along with single-player or multiplayer modes, where a maximum of two players can play the game at once. For ease of use, these options can be set up by buttons available on the Base Dome. In multiplayer games, whoever makes it to 11 points wins the game and gets some well-deserved bragging rights to boot. This makes the rules quite simple to understand even for young kids, which makes it an appealing product for those parents who want their children to get some physical activity in addition to their usual screen time.

  

The {{ sn-link }} comes with a detailed set of additional instructions that let you understand exactly how you can play the game without any hassles. Sharper Image recommends that the game should be played in a dimly lit room. As explained above, the smaller the room, the better gameplay you will get from your {{ sn-link }}. The manufacturer also defines that the {{ sn-link }} needs 7 AA batteries to work, with each of the rackets requiring two batteries and the Base Dome needing 3 of them.

  

According to users, the {{ link }} works according to its specifications when its instructions are followed properly. Users have noted that the equipment including the Base Dome and the rackets is well built and simple to operate, which allows them to play the game almost right off the bat. Users have mentioned that the game is easy to set up, and as the manufacturer suggests, works well in dimly lit environments with a smaller area.

  

Users have noted that the virtual ping pong game is just as interesting in its single-player mode as it is in its multiplayer challenge. This makes it a perfect fit for those who want to have a little fun on their own with a futuristic game, and also for those who like some bonding time with their loved ones over fun games.

  

Some users have mentioned that the overall game is difficult to play in larger areas or brightly lit environments. But since this is something that the manufacturer declares right on the product page, other users do not take any issues with this.

  

The {{ link }} is available at Amazon from $54. If you are looking for a modern spin on a classic indoor game, then you might want to check it out today.

Overall, the {{ link }} is a perfect fit for those who want to get some physical activity even while staying indoors.
