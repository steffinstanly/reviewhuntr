While all four elements of nature are quite integral to our life force, air is crucial to our literal breath. Every other second, we breathe in and breathe out air without thinking about it. It is just a natural thing for all living beings to do, even those such as animals and plants who do not know the deep complexities of science. As a result, sentient and non-sentient beings all see their lives flourish through the very nature of air and all the components that it holds within.

  

But to get the most out of what the air in the environment has to offer, it is essential for us that we keep our air clean as much as possible.
