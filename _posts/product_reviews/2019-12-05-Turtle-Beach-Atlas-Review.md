No matter what kind of games you play, if you are one to enjoy an immersive gaming experience, you will know that it doesn’t come without high-quality audio.

High-quality audio in gaming is vital.

But seeing that high-quality audio by itself doesn’t come at affordable prices, this remains a pipe dream for those gamers who spend a heavy amount maintaining their gaming PCs as well as buying the variety of titles that the gaming world has to offer. If you are a PC gamer, then you will be all too familiar with this scenario.

That’s where the {{ link }} comes in.


Built to deliver an immersive gaming experience, the {{ sn-link }} is a true gaming headset that has all the necessary features without the excessive price tag. Whether you are playing a multiplayer online game or a single-player campaign adventure, the headset is built to enhance your enjoyment by twofold.

  

With surround sound capability, high-sensitivity mic, comfortable built, and sturdy design, the {{ sn-link }} headset promises to provide an optimal listening experience amid other headsets in its price point. As the name suggests, the headset is optimized for PC gaming and works best with games that run on Windows machines.

  

The surround sound capacity of the headset works through Windows Sonic for Headphones, which is available through compatible Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. The feature also works with Dolby Atmos for Headphones. As a result, you can count on the headset to provide you with a true surround sound experience while you embark on virtual adventures through your favorite games.

  

Apart from surround sound, the {{ sn-link }} headset also aims to deliver clear and crisp sound quality. Since the headset comes with custom-tuned drivers for PC, it is an ideal device even for those times when you are not playing any games but simply want to relax with another form of audio. The clear sound and drivers features makes sure that not only your gaming sounds are delivered with razor-sharp clarity, but that you can enjoy powerful audio through other forms of multimedia such as music, TV shows or movies on your PC.

  

The high sensitivity microphone included with the {{ sn-link }} headset is yet another highly sought after feature in the audio device. Due to the way it’s built, the mic can pick up sounds easily and communicate them to the other end without any loss in audio. This means that you don’t have to shout your way through a game only to communicate with your team. You can speak to them like they are sitting right next to you, and your headset will be able to deliver your speech to them accurately. With a flip-up design, the mic also retracts upwards and settles against the outer surface of your headset speaker. This way, the mic doesn’t stick out for nothing when it’s not being used.

  

Along with the audio and mic quality, another major feature of the headset comes through in the form of its comfortable yet stylish design. With a metal-reinforced headband, the headset comes with added durability to boot. This headband and the speakers themselves are housed in a sleek structure that comes with a black body and contoured shape.

  

The lightweight headset boasts of a modern design, which also allows it to be glasses friendly. This means that if you wear glasses throughout the day, wearing the headset will not cause your glasses’ arms or temples to push into your skin. The memory foam padding on top of the speakers only adds to this comfort, and lets you enjoy hours of high-quality sound without giving you a headache or causing any discomfort. Since the memory foam is wrapped in synthetic leather, it doesn’t cause any abrasions against your ears.

  

The {{ sn-link }} headset also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which makes it easily compatible with almost every computer and laptop on the market. It also enhances the headset’s compatibility with phones as well as consoles such as Xbox One, PS4 Pro, PS4, and Nintendo Switch.

  

Coming to real-world use, those who have utilized this headset have many positive things to say about it. According to users, the headset provides a loud and clear sound that can turn any game into an immersive experience with its surround sound technology. Since the headset can be connected to any computer with its 3.5mn jack, its plug-and-play mechanism with no hassles of installation makes it very easy to use for all types of audio aficionados.

  

Users have also noted that the {{ sn-link }} comes in a comfortable design that doesn’t seem heavy. This makes sense given the dimensions of 8.21 x 3.74 x 9.37 inches and a weight of 1.05 lbs. Added features such as the metal-reinforced headband and memory foam covered speakers make the headset that much easier to wear.

  

A limited number of users have noted that the headset doesn’t have durable wires. But others have mentioned that the headset has a great built and performs all functions as intended.

  

At $34.95, the {{ sn-link }} headset is available with a 30% discount from Amazon.

It may be a wonderful purchase for you or as a gift for friends and family.
