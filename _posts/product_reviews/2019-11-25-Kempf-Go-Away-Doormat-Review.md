Whether we live in an apartment, a townhouse or a cottage, our home is very special to us. After all, it is the place where we live, eat, sleep and find solace from the challenges of life. That’s why most of us are intent on making it the best representation of our character. We want our home to reflect our life the way we live it. We want it to represent our view of the world. And we want it to speak for our sense of humor.

  

That’s why, when we see something that encapsulates our preferences of living, celebrates our perspective of the world, and captures the essence of our humor, we want to make it a part of our home right away.

  

That’s why, when you see the {{ link }}, you may immediately want it to layout next to your threshold.

  

That’s right. I said the {{ link }}. The {{ sn-link }} does exactly what its name suggests, with the words “Go Away” emblazoned over it in prominent letters. It is actually a rather simple item that makes a bold statement without being too flashy about it.

  

What I like about this particular mat is that it lets people know that you are not the typical resident within a neighbourhood. It tells them that you are not one to waste your time with incessant chatter. Nay, you would rather do other things with your precious time. And you are not afraid to say it out loud in a humorous way that doesn’t offend those with a sense of humor.

  

The {{ link }} lets people know that while you are interested in being grateful and living bountiful, you do not want to be disturbed. In essence, you state that those who drop by without your express knowledge should know what to do when they see the mat. On the other hand, it gives a reason to chuckle to those who know you and your humor to a T. Users have noted that the mat does a great job of being funny and adding levity to any environment, serving its intended purpose without getting on anyone’s bad side.

  

The {{ link }} is made up of coir material that comes with all the resistance and benefits of environmentally friendly fibers. To be precise, the mat is made of 100% natural coconut fibers. Since the ink is placed within the coconut fibers, the {{ sn-link }} manufacturer claims that mat can easily last you a while. The natural roughness of the material ensures that constant foot traffic doesn’t make it fade away within a few days. Whereas, the biodegradable nature of the coconut fibers makes sure that you are not affecting the environment negatively.

  

According to users, these features translate into real-life benefits very well. Many users have noted that the {{ link }} is durable and can last for more than 7 years. Some users comment that the mat has stayed intact even after 10 years of use. According to users, they have seen only minimal deterioration in their mats after consistent use, and the printed statement on it has lasted them for quite a while.

  

The mat’s coconut fiber material also ensures that it doesn’t retain water. This keeps it from being soggy or moldy after it has been left out in the rain or snow. Apart from odor control, this quality affects the mat’s overall life. Users have noted that their mat sustained weather effects such as rain and snow, and even then, managed to stay strong and sturdy. But the mat’s material can get damp with heavy water, so it’s essential that you pay attention to drying it off as soon as possible.

  

But even when it doesn’t retain moisture, the mat is very well suited for cleaning off dust and mud from the soles of shoes. It doesn’t have any rubber coating at the bottom, which makes it easy to clean. You can simply run it through water, and it gets good as new within a few minutes. Users have noted that this makes the mat very simple to maintain.

  

You will also be happy to know that {{ link }} only weighs 2.82 pounds. The specific product dimensions are 16 X 27 X 1 inches. This makes it easy to lift and move around for whenever you want to wash your stairs or dust off your threshold. Users have noted that the mat is thick enough and stands out against your door without being gaudy.

  

With that being said, a few users have complained about the quality of the mat. According to them, the mat that was shipped to them wasn’t the item shown in the pictures by the manufacturer. At the same time, most users have noted that they are happy with their purchase and it has fulfilled all their expectations.

  

At $19.95 apiece, the {{ link }} is a good purchase for everyone who likes a little humor in their everyday decor. Users have noted that the mat makes for a great conversation piece. This means that with the holidays just around the corner, it can prove to be a great addition to your especially if you are one to go down the “Bah, Humbug” route this time of year.

  

## Conclusion
