Those of us who love our dogs want to make sure that we give them everything they require to be happy in their homes. Whether it’s lots of belly rubs, warm hugs, or adventure walks, we do our best to meet all of our dog’s needs every single day.

  

One such need comes in the form of plenty of playtime throughout the day. That’s why, if you are the proud parent of a pup or two, you would know exactly how important toys are for our dogs’ health. Sure, they provide plenty of playtime, but they also provide the exercise and stimulation needed to keep our dogs healthy and happy.

  

The {{ link }} is one such playful solution that promises a ton of fun and stimulation for your bundle of joy. Packaged in a pack of 3, the {{ sn-link }} comes in different variations and sizes. The chew toy promises to be durable yet fun and is built in a way that is bound to attract all kinds of dogs for hours of fun.

  

Precisely, the {{ sn-link }} uses some of the most popular dog chew toy designs and combines them into its offerings. With a bone, ball and rope design, this pack of 3 toys has all the makings of becoming your dog’s all-time favorite with just a single play. But extended play doesn’t mean that the toys are going to wear down in just a few days. PUPTECK promises that the way the toys are built makes them long-lasting, while the odourless and safe thermoplastic rubber (TPR) material ensures the safety of your dogs.

  

The first toy in the {{ sn-link }} pack of 3 is a pastel pink-coloured bone that has tiny and blunt spikes all over its ends, and a ribbed section along its mid-length. Since the toy is made out of TPR, it is safe, soft and moldable. The bone is tied to braided and colorful cotton ropes from either end that come in pastel shades of pink, blue, and yellow. This makes the toy look just as adorable as it is functional for your dog.

  

The two other toys come in the shape of balls. Tied to braided ropes from either end in the same colors as the bone toy, these balls are also very versatile in play and can be used to play fetch or toss with your adorable doggo. These balls are also made out of TPR that makes them safe yet durable.

  

The {{ sn-link }} also promises to be good for your dog’s oral health. Since the TPR is molding yet supple, it gives your dog’s teeth plenty of much-needed exercise without being too harsh on their canines and other teeth. This is due to the ribbed, embossed and engraved design of the toys that sets them apart from other toys that are simply smooth and do not provide the needed stimulation to teeth. But since these toys are uneven in terms of their surface design, they also give your dogs’ gums the massage they need to stay healthy and away from many oral health diseases. PUPTECK promises that its toys are made with safety in mind, which is why the TPR used is odorless even if it is colored.

  

PUPTECK has also ensured that the toys are all different sizes, even when their style is similar in the case of the two ball toys included in the package. Specifically, the bone rope toy comes with the dimensions of 16.3 x 2.5 inches. One of the ball toys boasts of the size of 12.2 x 2.95 inches. Whereas, the other ball rope toy comes with the dimensions of 12.9 x 2.63 inches. These different sizes ensure that you are getting a variety of toys even if they seem similar at first glance.

  

When it comes to everyday usage, those who have used these toys for their pups swear by their effectiveness. Users have noted that their dogs found the toys to be very enjoyable to the point where they start taking them everywhere they went. According to users, the chew toys serve their purpose and offer plenty of chewing and teeth exercise time for their dogs.

  

PUPTECK specifies that the toys are made for medium to large dog breeds. Users have noted that the claim is true since the toys quickly grabbed the attention of their medium to large-sized dogs easily. According to users, the TPR material of the bone and balls seem to be the big draw for dogs in terms of chewing, and the rope material only adds to the overall value of the toy for their dogs and their desire for playtime. Users have also noted that the toys are durable and seem to fit the needs of their playful pups.

  

PUPTECK promises that the toys are safe for dogs and owners for supervised play. But the company mentions that they are not to be played by kids. This particular warning gives some users a reason to be a bit concerned. But other users have noted that playing with the toys didn’t bring any harm to their pups and instead only gave them the hours’ worth of playtime that they sought.

  

At $11.99, the {{ link }} Pack of 3 is available at Amazon. If you are one to spoil your dog with plenty of toys, then these pastel-coloured creations may prove to be a good addition to their toy chest.

  

## Conclusion

All in all, the {{ link }} offers great value for money while providing plenty of playtime to your dogs. With their durability, versatility and design, this pack of toys can be a great personal gift for your furball. If you are looking for a new set of toys that are safe and healthy to play with, then this package from PUPTECK might be exactly what you are looking for.
