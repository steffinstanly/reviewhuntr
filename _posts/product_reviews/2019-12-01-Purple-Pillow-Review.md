With stressful hours at work, demanding physical sessions at the gym, and mentally taxing schmoozing at social engagements, anyone in the current day and age yearns for a good night’s sleep that comes without additional tossing and turning.

  

If you seek the same kind of comfort when you head to bed, then you might find yourself facing tough luck. Even if your mattress is the perfect rendition of the clouds, the more important aspect in terms of your pillow may very well lack the support that you need for a perfect night of sleep.

  

That’s where the {{ link }} comes in.

  

The {{ link }} is one of the flagship products by {{ sn-link }} Mattress, a company that is becoming quite popular for its revolutionary mattresses that promise to be better than other sleeping solutions on the market. And for the most part, they are.

  

In terms of the {{ link }}, the manufacturer shows its prowess in terms of the overall built, design and functionality of what may otherwise seem like a normal pillow. As a result, the {{ link }} promises to relieve you of all the issues you can face before, during or after your sleep.

  

For starters, the {{ link }} claims to provide optimal neck and head support. No matter if you sleep on your back, your sides, or even with your face resting right against the pillow, you can rest assured to get the perfect support that is personalized for you. This is possible due to Purple’s signature Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, which is firm around its edges but is soft in the middle.

  

Instead of a slab-like layer of foam or a mushed together material of fiber, the {{ link }} is made out of hundreds of tiny {{ sn-link }} Hyper-Elastic Polymer triangles. This provides the pillow with a subversive design and feel, but the company promises that the sleep which comes from the pillow is anything but jarring. {{ sn-link }} promises that this triangle material and design ensures that you do not have to fluff your pillow to make it comfortable or adjust it to let out any trapped heat.

  

As a result, {{ sn-link }} claims to take away the hassles of maintaining your pillow on your own and leaves you with the simple task of resting your head on your new pillow whenever you need some sweet slumber. The Hyper-Elastic Polymer is hypoallergenic and antimicrobial. This means that you can enjoy this pillow for years to come without any fear of aggravating your allergies or catching harmful germs through it. The material is also certified by the FDA for being safe. If you need further proof for its safety, then you can rest assured in the knowledge that the material is also CertiPUR-US­ certified.

  

The {{ link }} comes with a polyethylene copolymer powder coating that is also non-toxic. Along with it, you can also receive a white cover that is made out of a blend of polyester, bamboo viscose and spandex. With dimensions of 24″ x 16″ x 3″, the {{ link }} is fit for all kinds of beds. Whether you are more comfortable in a single bed or if you don’t want to sleep in a bed that’s anything less than King size, the {{ link }} can be the perfect match for you and your favourite portal to the world of sleep.

  

Coming to practical usage, those who have bought this pillow cannot stop singing praises of its functionality. According to users, the Hyper-Elastic Polymer does what it claims to do, and provides the kind of head and neck support that you may not expect from a pillow with hundreds of triangles embedded in its very design. Users have mentioned that due to the way the pillow has been made, it doesn’t need any kind of fluffing or adjustments from their end to get the perfect level of support during bedtime. Users have mentioned that they can simply slide into bed and rest their head on the {{ link }} without taking minutes to get the perfect angle.

  

With a weight of 10.2 lbs, the {{ link }} is the heaviest pillow of the world. While this may seem like nothing to boast about, the feature does provide the {{ link }} with the ability to withstand years of usage without losing its original shape. According to those users who have been using the {{ link }} for a while, the claims seem to be true due to how the pillow has retained its original shape since they started sleeping on it.

  

Since the pillow doesn’t trap heat and provides plenty of insulation through its triangle design, it doesn’t get too hot or too cold during the night. Users have also stood behind this feature and have mentioned that the pillow provides them with the perfect temperature of a surface to rest their head-on.

  

Early owners of the {{ link }} noticed issues with an inflatable insert or booster where it fell flat after a few days of use. But according to the most recent purchasers of the pillow, the inflatable booster is no longer included in the newer model. This has solved the older problems and has now made the {{ link }} something that is enjoyed by almost all new users to the point where they term it as a great product even for its steep price point.

  

Available for $89 at Amazon, the {{ link }} is yours to take home through an easy online purchase.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} provides great value for money to most of its users and promises a pillow that’s no fuss and all performance. With the issues of the past models now resolved, the {{ link }} could be the exact solution you need to enjoy a good night’s sleep.
