Regardless of our age, all of us have a little sense of wonder inside of us. Depending upon our taste, this wonder shines through when we see something truly amazing, breathtaking, or mind-blowing. In other instances, the execution of wonder doesn’t have to come out of something larger than life. It emerges even through simple demonstrations of things that defy the general order.

  

That is why, magic tricks such as disappearing acts, conjuring routines, and levitation scenes are so fascinating for everyone who has a sense of wonder. In fact, those of us who want to take it to the next level often try to learn a trick or two of our own, so we could demonstrate them to friends and family and make sure that we entertain them in a very personalized way.

  

If you fall under that category of people, then you will be delighted to know about the {{ link }}. Before you think of it as a side-quest item from a video game, it is a very real indoor plant product that you can easily order all by yourself. The best part? The {{ link }} is exactly what the name describes: a {{ sn-link }} that levitates wherever you put it. Interested enough? You will want to know what this item has in store for you.

  

The {{ link }} comes in the form of a small pot that has a lush green {{ sn-link }} in it. The {{ sn-link }} is actually a living, breathing organism that looks like a plant but survives on oxygen, which is why it only requires a fresh supply of air. This allows the {{ link }} to never need water or soil, keeping your centrepiece fresh without leaving any mess or odor around that comes with taking care of indoor plants. But that’s not even the most impressive part of the {{ link }}.

  

The amazing part comes in how it levitates off of its matching base plate. This quality makes the {{ link }} seem like an item straight from the magical worlds of your favorite Hobbits from Lord of the Rings, or the schools of witchcraft and wizardry from the Harry Potter series. This effect is enough to take you back into the magical world of your childhood and does so flawlessly for anyone who’s visiting your home or office. Since the {{ link }} doesn’t need any sort of visible strings or stand to achieve its levitating effect, it looks like a mix of special effects that have jumped out of the big screen of your favorite fantasy movie.

  

This effect is achieved by a strategic placement of magnets and electric sensors within the {{ link }} pot and base plate. These magnets allow the components to emanate certain magnetic charges that repel the pot and the base plate from touching each other, while still being light enough for the pot to levitate over its base. It is indeed a wonder of science and craftsmanship. But to the naked eye, it looks like magic.

  

As a result, users who equally believe in science and magic are quite enamored by this product and mention that they like the effects that it gives off through its levitation. Users have noted that that the levitation effect is clean and stable, which makes sure that the {{ link }} doesn’t look ungraceful.

  

The {{ link }} also uses electro-magnetic rays to power its functions, which means that you will need to plug it into an AC outlet to make it work. It doesn’t need any additional settings, setup, or supplies. All that it needs is a clean surface where you can settle its base plate with the pot on top of it. Users note that this makes the device very easy to use.

  

The {{ sn-link }} within the pot retains moisture and oxygen from the air surrounding it. It also thrives with a decent amount of sunlight. These natural resources act as the food for the organism, which stays green year-round regardless of the season you are going through. Users have noted that this makes the {{ link }} provide them with great value for money. At $99.99, the item is definitely not considered a dollar store novelty piece. That’s why this particular quality speaks in its favor as a purchase to enhance your surroundings.

  

The {{ link }} weighs a little over 2 lbs. According to the manufacturer’s provided pictures, it is available in just one color, which happens to be light wood. Its actual dimensions are not mentioned by the manufacturer, but users have stated that it is quite smaller than they thought. This complaint runs through most of the users who are not very satisfied with their purchase. Whereas, others who have taken no issue with the size say that they like the way the product works and keeps its levitation going with just an AC power supply. Some users have mentioned that the product stopped working after a few days, whereas others say that they have been using their item since quite a while. Users have also noted that the {{ sn-link }} swirls whenever it’s gently hit with a gust of wind, which adds to its visual effects.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} can serve as a good conversation piece, add a lush green color and bring a sense of wonder to an otherwise bland desk. The {{ sn-link }} that comes with the product is a curious little organism itself, which makes it all the more interesting to have it on your favorite surface.

  

It would also make for a great present for your friends and family this holiday season - just as long as they are not expecting their {{ link }} to be of a certain size. Simply put, if you do not expect your {{ link }} to boast of certain dimensions, then the product may prove to be the perfect fit for you.
