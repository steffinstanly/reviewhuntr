No matter the kind of work we do or the type of life we live, it can be safely said that we’re all very busy getting through our days. Some of us are running around to take the kids to school, while others are making sure to do all their chores on time. Some are scrambling to get to work by beating rush hour traffic, while others are simply dealing with a myriad of errands regularly.



But through this hustle and bustle, one thing that we must always remember is the importance of our health. Even if it seems that we cannot find the time to take care of our wellbeing, we must realize that proper nutrition is quite critical in our lives. After all, taking care of ourselves helps us perform well and do our best in all the activities that we participate in regularly.
  

And what is one of the quickest ways to get a boost of nutrition when you are starting your day?

  
Eggs!

  

Eggs are simple and pack a nutritious punch. They give you vitamin A, vitamin B5, vitamin B12, vitamin B2, phosphorous, folate, and even selenium. They also boast of holding vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and essentials such as calcium. But that’s not all. They also carry an impressive 5 grams of protein in each serving, making eggs the ideal food of athletes all over the world.

  

If those nutrition stats were not enough, you would be delighted to know that eggs also hold various antioxidants. They can also positively raise the HDL or the good type of cholesterol in our bodies too. Simply put, eggs are one of the best foods for your brain and body. A daily dose of them can make you stronger and healthier to take on life’s challenges every day.

  

But the problem is that we do not always have the time to even boil our eggs. This makes breakfast even more difficult for those who prefer poached eggs, scrambled eggs or omelets for that matter.
