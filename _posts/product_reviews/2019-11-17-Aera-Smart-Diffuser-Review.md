It will not be incorrect to state that we want to have the best ambiance and the greatest of environments all of the time. I mean, have you seen those Peloton ads? They are usually surrounded by elegant surroundings with great decor to boot. There is a reason why we never see those ads with random Amazon packages strewn throughout the place, clothes laying around in a messy way, or other items being generally out of order. It is because they have to appeal to your senses to make an impression.

  

But our ambiance isn’t just about the visual aspects. It is also about things such as our sense of smell. In fact, we go to great lengths to make our houses smell nice. I know friends who have incense sticks, who carry essential oils, and those who use scented candles to make their homes a little brighter through some aromatherapy.

  

Well, guess what? Now we have technology stepping in to make this part of our lives a tad bit better.

  

And this is our segue to talk about the {{ link }}. Simply put, the device is a scent diffuser. But unlike other diffusers that work by the press of your hand, the {{ sn-link }} Fragrance uses fan powered air along with its scent capsules to allow for different strengths of aromas at various times. Its smart interface allows you to experiment with scent intensities to elevate your mood. How cool is that?

Apparently very much so, if the users are to be believed. Even at the price of $200, the {{ sn-link }} Home Diffuser is quite in demand. Thanks to those who have either already bought it or who want to purchase it, the nifty device is gaining quite some traction among those who with a penchant for home decor.

  

The {{ sn-link }} Home diffuser comes in a very sleek and modern design that has the dimensions of 6.5 x 2.5 x 4.75 in. This means that it is slightly larger in width than a large candle, but is almost the same height. With a white colored coating and a silver surface on top, it looks more like a small flask than your typical scent diffuser, which is the first quality that stands out about the device. Users have noted that the diffuser’s design is one of those features that they value the most about it.

  

When you move past the looks, the {{ link }} lives up to its name. The smart device connects to WiFi to download its settings and can be controlled via its iOS and Android AeraForHome app. This allows you to set a schedule for the aroma release from anywhere. The fragrance by itself comes in a variety of scents, which range from woody to sweet, and from floral to intense variants. These fragrances are available in the form of essential oil capsules, which are available from Aera itself.

  

What does this intricate process mean for you if you want your home or office to smell like heavens all the time? Simple. All you have to do is to buy the essential oil capsules from Aera, put them in the device, and then set up your fragrance release schedule through the app. With 10 different settings to release the scent, you can select from a mild fragrance to an intense boost of your selected essential oil capsule. According to users, the process is quite simple and only takes a few minutes to set up at the time of first use.

  

According to users, the device provides an even rush of aroma throughout its area. This is possible due to its ability to release all the ingredients in the essential oil capsules at once, as opposed to other diffusers that release their fragrances in order of volatility. As a result, you get a sudden rush of consistent scent that has all the notes of a fragrance capsule, instead of getting whiffs of select ingredients.

  

The essential oil capsules come at about $55 apiece. They are non-refillable. But each of them promises up to 800 hours of use. They are available in dozens of different variations, including popular fragrances such as lavender, citrus, rose, sandalwood and vanilla. All of these natural and essential oils are hypoallergenic. Their intensity is also adjustable according to the diffuser’s settings, which means that you can bid farewell to the days of catching a headache from an overwhelming scent. These fragrances are sold separately and are not available within the price of the device itself. But users have noted that they are easily available from Amazon.

  

The {{ link }} releases an even intensity of scent all right. But the way it does over a large area of approximately 1,000 square feet is what sets it apart from many other diffusers. According to users, this coverage range is one of the best qualities of the smart diffuser. Many users have noted that the diffuser has been able to overcome many strong and pungent smells in their homes, such as the smell of carpets and pets.

  

A limited number of users have taken an issue with the way the {{ link }} releases its scents. According to them, there is not just enough intensity in the aroma that is released by the diffuser. Most of these users also state that they find the essential oil capsules to be too expensive. With that being said, other users have simply maintained that they are very happy with the overall package that the {{ link }} brings to the table.

  

The device is also available in a conventional, “Touch” variation that doesn’t have the capability of being app-controlled. But it comes at a slightly lower price tag of $150.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} does what it’s supposed to, and provides an easy way to brighten your home through different scents and aromas of your choice. Most users are content with what the diffuser brings to the table, where they especially praise its sleek aesthetic.

  

If you don’t mind spending a noticeable amount of money to make your home smarter and your environment more pleasing, the {{ link }} might just be the perfect fit for you.
