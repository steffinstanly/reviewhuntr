When you think of smart assistants in today’s day and age, Amazon Alexa’s name ranks on top of the list. While competitors such as Apple Siri and Google Assistant have come a long way in terms of voice assistance, Alexa still rankings superior in popularity simply due to the {{ sn-link }} devices that are offered by Amazon.

  

Among those {{ sn-link }} devices, the {{ link }} stands out as the next generation of smart assistants. It is mostly due to the video display of the device, which takes assisted entertainment to the next level. That is the reason why everyone from your grandma to your second cousin once removed wants to get their hands on an {{ link }}. And if you want in as well, then no one can blame you.

  

What we can do is review one of the most sought after variations of the {{ link }}, in the form of the {{ link }} 2nd Generation device.

  

With the Amazon {{ link }}, individuals can cook and clean while having music playing in the background or a Ted Talk on Youtube. They can relax while taking on chores and immerse themselves in great content while doing potential humdrum chores.

  

Available directly from Amazon, the {{ link }} 2nd Generation device comes with a 10.1” HD touchscreen (1280x800p) and the promise of a premium sound experience with two 2.2” speakers @ 10W per channel. It also comes with a 5MP camera and front mics, which can be electronically disconnected using relevant controls. It rounds its technical specs with its Intel Atom x5-Z8350 processor, which gives it the power to perform its tasks with ease.

  

Since the Amazon {{ link }} is mostly the Amazon Echo Plus speaker with a screen, the device is still largely controlled via voice. But similar to the touchscreen, you can also use the built-in volume buttons for your ease. Users note that these features provide Alexa with enough capabilities to be used as a powerful multimedia device.

  

The device is available in two colors, namely charcoal and sandstone. With clean lines and rounded edges, the device itself looks straight out of a spaceship drama especially when you have placed the slightly tilted frame against your counter or coffee table. Unlike other tablets or similar devices of its size, the {{ link }} is meant to be interacted with while resting on a surface. This makes it quite interesting to use especially if you are making your switch from a conventional tablet. According to users, the design remains quite modern and very likable, while also being able to fit into their homes easily.

  

But the device doesn’t stop selling its features on looks alone. Since the whole selling point of the {{ link }} is its voice assistance, it comes with premium speakers that are packed with Dolby processing. The result comes out in the form of crystal clear but loud sound that make the device really interesting to interact with. Users have noted that the sound of the {{ link }} 2nd Generation is one of the best features of the device. Apart from this, they also note that the simple Wi-Fi setup also makes it easy to use the device.

  

Playing music is one of the most basic yet important features on the {{ link }} 2nd Generation as well. And the device fulfills this requirement with quite some elan. It can show additional lyrics and album art through Amazon Music while it plays your songs, while also letting you enjoy your favorite music videos through Vevo, or via Bluetooth from or to your mobile device. It is also compatible with Spotify, which makes the task of listening to music that much more convenient for those who have premade playlists on the popular music streaming service. Users have noted that the {{ link }} 2nd Gen delivers a great listening experience, which can start and stop at a simple voice command.

  

But apart from music, the {{ link }} 2nd Gen also comes with the promise of video apps such as those from Hulu, CNN, and NBC. You can watch your favorite shows in the absence of a TV. That’s not all. You can also watch recipe videos and cook along with the device, simply by giving a command to Alexa. This is helpful when you are cooking in the kitchen and would like a device that would help to enhance your experience without bothering anyone in your home about dictating recipes to you.

  

And according to users, this interaction is where the real power of the device is shown.

  

Since Alexa is an artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism that’s based on machine learning, it can learn from its mistakes. Each time it slips up, it simply gets smarter. So if it messes up in recognizing your voice command for your favorite song, you can rest assured that it will do anything but repeat the same mistake. Alexa also comes with the ability to learn new skills and do more with apps. It is also bilingual since it can speak in both English and Spanish. This is why, out of all the features that the {{ link }} 2nd Gen comes with, users find Alexa to be the prime offering. Almost all users of the device have noted that they find Alexa to be a highly interactive and very interesting demonstration of modern technology.

  

Apart from all of these features, {{ link }} also acts as a security monitor. If you set it up with the Zigbee system, then it can let you interact with whoever’s at your door with 2-way audio. You can also receive security notifications right at your {{ link }} screen. The limited number of users who have used this feature found this to be helpful as well.

  

The device comes with a 6 ft. power adapter and a quick start guide while boasting the dimensions of 9.7” x 6.9” x 4.2”. It weighs just over 62 oz. or 1765 grams, which is not that bulky for a device in this stature. The device can be configured with the Alexa app, which is available for Fire OS, iOS, and Android devices.

  

Even with all its features, a limited number of users has found a drawback in the {{ link }} 2nd Gen, which comes in the form of restricted customization. But this particular problem is only cited by a handful of users since others are more than happy with their purchase.

  
  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} 2nd Gen provides a great smart home assistant in a very interactive device. If you are one to enjoy voice assistants and want to befriend the best in class Alexa, then going with the {{ link }} 2nd Gen would be a great choice. With minimal drawbacks and mostly positive reviews, it might just be the perfect holiday gift for your family.
