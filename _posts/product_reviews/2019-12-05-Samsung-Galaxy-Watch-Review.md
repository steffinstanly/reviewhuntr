In today’s day and age, those of us who value technology want to own at least the most essential gadgets in their best form possible. But even when we do our best, getting an expensive smartphone is all that we can achieve. Since we spend most or all of our money on our phones, it leaves very little room for additional gadgets and leaves us yearning for the day we can own all the smart devices we want.

  

Thanks to {{ sn-link }} by Amazon Renewed, you don’t have to wait too long for that day to come.



The {{ link }} comes with the promise of delivering a state of the art smart watch experience at an affordable price. As an Amazon Renewed product, the smartwatch comes at an even more discounted price while still boasting of a 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee.

  

With a conventional black strap design and a circular dial, the {{ sn-link }} comes with all the right style accents that immediately deem it to be a great fit for athletes and even those who simply want to practice an active lifestyle. Its swim-ready design, durable built, and lightweight features further add to the smartwatch’s value proposition as the perfect accessory for those who like activewear or want to make a smartwatch a part of their everyday attire.

  

The {{ sn-link }} comes with the feature to track your vital statistics against real exercises. With the ability to detect up to 6 exercises while tracking up to 39 more routines, the smartwatch fits the bill of its “active” descriptor perfectly. The smartwatch detects your heart rate and sends real-time alerts to help you take necessary actions when it gets high or low. This way, you can take quick measures to prevent a medical emergency or simply be able to stay active throughout the day whenever you are about to doze off out of nowhere. But the smartwatch doesn’t stop there. It also allows you to assess your sleep patterns and comes with winding down exercises to help you relax at night.

  

The smartwatch is compatible with both Samsung Galaxy as well as Apple iPhone 5 and above. With it, it also boasts of complete compatibility with Android 5.0+ and iOS 9.0+. This makes it a versatile device that does not require you to stay loyal to a single brand. As long as your smartphone runs on over 1.5 GB of RAM, you can connect your watch to it rather easily.

  

Apart from being a device that’s focused on helping you live a healthier life, the {{ sn-link }} also comes with the ability to stream your phone playlist and show phone notifications right at its screen. This way, you can ensure that even when you have your phone resting in your pocket during a run or in your bag at the gym, you can enjoy your favorite music and keep connected with the real world.

  

The {{ sn-link }} comes with a rechargeable battery, where a single charge has the promise to last more than a day. This makes the smartwatch a highly versatile yet long-lasting device, which doesn’t require troublesome upkeep or expensive maintenance.

  

According to users, the smartwatch meets all its intended purposes with ease while boasting of a very simple to use interface. Since the smartwatch can connect to a variety of phones and support an array of exercise statistics, it allows users to benefit from all its capabilities without getting into too much technicalities. This makes the smartwatch a very sought after device especially for those who do not want their precious workout routine to be disturbed with longer setup times.

  

Users have noted that the modern design of the smartwatch works wonders in terms of comfort. Users have mentioned that even after wearing the watch all day, it didn’t result in any discomfort for their wrist or arm. This is possible due to the watch’s minuscule weight of 0.96 ounces, and its comfortable fit with the dimensions of 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.4 inches. According to users, the ability to change the watch’s band at your own discretion also adds to its value-added qualities. This way, you can make sure not to use a band that has taken the route to look shabby with consistent usage.

  

Speaking of this particular Amazon Renewed product, users have noted that it is indeed good as new and came with its very own charger. According to users, the watch they received was in excellent condition and did not look like it had been used at all. Most users have commented that the watch they received did not even have a single scratch on it, which took them by pleasant surprise.

  

Users have noted that the watch can stay running for up to 28 hours on an average basis after a charge of 2 hours. While it is a compromise on the original battery timing, users have mentioned that it isn’t a hassle given the discount that they receive on the original price as well as the good-as-new condition that they enjoy against it.

  

Apart from its ability to track performance during different exercises and detecting sleep patterns, users have also mentioned that the smartwatch is a very good way to track their steps without paying for more expensive alternatives. The smartwatch also remains a user favorite for receiving phone notifications directly to their wrist instead of having to get their phone out of their pocket or bag each time it receives an alert.

  

A very limited number of users take issue with the way the watch is built. But overall, a majority of users are more than content with the watch’s design, style and material.

  

At $144, the {{ sn-link }} is available at Amazon. A rose gold alternative with a pink strap comes at the price of $169.90.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ sn-link }} with its Amazon Renewed state provides you with great value for money. Whether you are looking for a device to help you stay active or detect your sleep patterns, encourage you to walk more or pay more attention to your health, the {{ sn-link }} can prove to be a very effective first step towards achieving your objective.
