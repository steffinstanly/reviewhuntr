Digital art has come a long way since the first RAND tablet was released in 1964. Even though some things remain the same, graphic tablets and their stylus have changed a lot since the initial prototypes. But what caused the biggest impact is, without a doubt, the appearance of monitor drawing tablets, also known as display tablets.

If you are an artist trying to delve into the digital world, you’ve probably done some research into the different kinds of tablets available today. So of course, we have two main types: the non-display tablets where the user needs to be looking at their PC screen while drawing on the surface, and the display tablets.

For beginners, non-display tablets work perfectly. But while the artist gets more and more used to digital media, an upgrade might be good. Truth is, there are certain limitations when using a drawing tablet without a screen. And while you can still create amazing artworks with a regular tablet, if you are considering art as more than a hobby you should have in mind all the different options.

A great option to consider is the {{ link }} drawing tablet. This device is the perfect compromise between a good built and amazing quality while keeping it affordable when compared to other tablets of similar specifications.

The {{ link }} is a sleek 19.5 full HD IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution. It supports up to 8192 levels of pen pressure, the highest pressure level to this date.
Users have rated this device positively, and it reaches 4.1 out of 5 stars on Amazon.
Most commented on the build quality as sleek and sturdy with a smooth plastic finish. Artists that use the keyboard for shortcuts, found the minimalist setup (with no extra buttons) extremely useful. However, users that preferred shortcuts on the tablet itself found it lacking at first, but easy to get used to.

The stand provided with the tablet is commented to be extremely versatile since it can bend to almost any angle and lock firmly, so the user won’t experience any wobbling.

The screen is a 19.5-inch IPS display that comes in a 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution. It comes with a 72% NTSC color gamut, 3000:1 contrast ratio which and can display 16.7 million colors. It comes with already with a matte screen protector pre-attached intended to give the surface a paper-like feel. However, most users preferred to peel it off, since the film is not entirely transparent (thus, dulling the colors), and it also tends to scratch due to the movement of the stylus.
The bare screen offers a better experience, according to most users. Though you would have to be careful to properly clean the display after peeling off the film, as it leaves a light residue. For long it is recommended buying an actual screen protector from an electronics shop and have them attach it on the screen for you, to avoid air bubbles.

Huion’s tablet settings app is commented to be incredibly robust, more so than any other non-Wacom brands. The pen accuracy and pressure sensitivity are amazing, and the tracking is completely lag-free. Some users experienced a slight yellow bleed when scrolling down, but it was quickly fixed by adjusting the settings.

Regarding the pen, the {{ link }} comes with two pens so that one can charge while you work with the other, to avoid running out of battery. Nonetheless, the battery life is incredibly long, lasting up to more than a week of heavy use. As it is common in most stylus, the {{ sn-link }}
pen comes with two buttons that can be used for any shortcuts you assign them or disabled if the user so desires. It’s commented that they have a nice quality feel, and they are not flimsy as other models. The shape of the pen itself is slightly different compared to other styluses, but not difficult to get used to.

Some commented that the pen is entirely plastic, and it would have been better if it had a rubber band for better grip, but that it’s not a deal-breaker.
On the topic of the pen, some were pleasantly surprised with how long-lasting the nibs are. The tablet comes with 8 spare nibs inside, but after heavy usage, the user's notice no signs of degradation, even after more than a year of use.

Regarding the pressure, some commented that it’s hard to tell the difference with accuracy, since the levels are so high already, but it performs perfectly, and the transition between light to hard strokes were much smoother compared to other tablet monitors.

The main complaint regarding the {{ link }} is that the cable connectors are placed on the back of the tablet, so it’s not possible to lay it flat on a table. 
This is not an overlook from {{ sn-link }} since the tablet is intended to be used propped up on the stand and not completely horizontal. However, artists that are used to placing their tablets on a flat surface should be aware that the table needs to be placed at a slight angle for comfortable drawing.


## Conclusion


In conclusion, the {{ link }} proves to be an excellent drawing tablet, with nice build quality and a lot of room on the screen for any artwork, displaying all UI elements while keeping it minimal. It’s easy to set up and install, and the stand is sturdy, allowing for a solid grip and no rattle. The pressure sensitivity is amazing, and the color accuracy is close to perfect.
All in all, it’s the perfect alternative to other display tablets that offer similar features for three times the price.
