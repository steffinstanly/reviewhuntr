With an increased level of awareness towards healthy eating, more and more people are looking into healthier food choices than ever before. Red meat is being replaced by plant-based proteins, oily fries are stepping aside for kale chips, and sugary sodas are going out of style in favor of fruity smoothies.

  

That is why people have started investing in equipment and appliances that makes them enjoy delicious foods without putting their health on the line. Air fryers, food processors, and power blenders are now becoming a norm in those kitchens which had never seen the stove being turned on before.

  

As a result, we see an increase in the demand and sales of these appliances. This means that if you are searching the market for machines that can help you adapt healthy eating, then you are not alone. A lot of product choices will be available for you at every step. But the key is to select something that fits your needs the best.

  

The {{ link }} is one such powerhouse appliance that tries to stand out amid an array of other competitors. All in all, it pulls off that feat quite impressively.

  

With 10 different speeds and 6 programmed cycles, it promises to make your smoothies, salsas, batter and even hot soups in literally a click of a button. It also comes with a blunt stainless-steel blade that promises to keep your fingers safe during cleanup, but cuts through fruits and mix through liquids powerfully. This makes the blender very easy to use and simple to clean up.

  

The {{ sn-link }} stays true to its name and sports a classic, square blender design that has an immediate old-diner feel to it. But its build is sleek enough for it to fit into any modern kitchen. With a transparent but BPA-free jar that has a whopping 90 ounce volume and 36 ounce blending capacity, the {{ sn-link }} stands tall among other appliances in its class. The look is topped off with its molded plastic finish, which in the case of the GO Travel jar, comes in a black color.

  

But if you wanted something smaller, then the blender can come in handy with its additional BPA-free GO Travel Bottle. This mini jar comes with a 34 ounce total volume and a 24 ounce blending capacity, which makes it just large enough to hold a sufficient amount of your drinks without being too heavy on your hands. This jar also comes with a travel lid so you could drink it on the go. You can also take your drinks on the road by blending into disposable cups.

  

When it comes to practical use, the {{ sn-link }} holds up its end of the bargain. Users have noted that the blender provides them with enough power to blend their juices and smoothies with almost no pulp left behind. They also state that the different settings of textures lets them control how they went their smoothies to turn, which is a plus for those who are getting this blender for healthy drinks and smoothie recipes.

  

But for those who want more value for money, the {{ sn-link }} also offers a little something on top of its basic features. Apart from the ability to blend fruits into smoothies, it can also mix dry and wet ingredients into batter. Once again, it promises to do so with different consistency of your choice. According to users, the machine does deliver on this promise with its different settings and commercial-grade motor.

  

That’s not all, either. The {{ sn-link }} also offers the feature to make warm soups using the friction of its motor. But this feature is not just limited to blending fresh ingredients into soup or actually heating up already prepared soup. The company promises that you can use this feature to heat up your pre-made drinks to give them a consistency that’s reminiscent of fresh beverages. According to users who have used the blender, this feature adds to the overall multi-purpose use of the appliance and provides them with more value for money in a single machine.

  

When it comes to size, the {{ sn-link }} stands out from smaller counterparts. As mentioned above, its jars already boast of large volume and blending capacities. But the appliance itself boasts of the dimensions of 14 x 11.8 x 9.8 inches. But, and here’s the kicker, this makes the blender quite heavyweight with 11.15 lbs. With that being said, this is pretty much on par with other similar appliances, since a blender is not something that you will carry around much after it has found its signature place on your kitchen counter.

  

A small number of users have noted that the company’s customer service is not as great as they expected it to be, given that Blendtec comes at a high price from a reputable manufacturer. Other users seem to take an issue with the noise level of the machine, which according to them could be a lot quieter. But even then, they seem to agree that the {{ sn-link }} does its job quite well and proves itself as an easy to use machine.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ sn-link }} provides ample value for money while also being able to perform more than just blending for its users. If you want a machine that churns out quick and silky smoothies while also performing a host of other functions, then the appliance will be the perfect fit for you. But if you are a bit skeptical about the noise level, which is present in almost all blenders, then looking into something else might be better suited for you.

  

With that being said, if simple use, powerful functions, and easy cleanup are some of the qualities that you are finding in a blender, then you may not need to look any further than the {{ sn-link }}.
