No matter how old you are, the thought of playing a game involving the Mario Bros. is enough to bring a smile to your face. With popular titles and interesting characters, the game’s universe has become such a part of our lives that it’s difficult to leave it behind.

 

If you are once such gaming aficionado who loves all things, Mario and Luigi, then you wouldn’t want to miss out on 
{{ sn-link }}.

 

Following up on past hits Luigi’s Mansion (2001) and Luigi’s Mansion Dark Moon (2013), {{ sn-link }} is the latest offering in the action-adventure franchise. Available for Nintendo Switch and compatible with its Joy-Cons, the game is wholesome family fun for everyone. It sports an interesting game-play with a funny story-line and wonderful graphics, which gives it the ability to win the hearts of players of every age.

 

In the game, your objective is to help Luigi battles ghosts and challenges in a haunted hotel to help free his big brother Mario, Princess Peach and a trio of Toads from the dark fate of being sealed inside paintings forever. The game-play is based upon the previous two entries in the franchise, with certain enhancements added to enhance your experience.

 

The plot is simple yet interesting. When Luigi wins a free stay at the world-class hotel called The Last Resort, the opportunity seems too good to pass up. Seeing that isn’t a mansion but a hotel, Luigi spends no time in preparing for his dream vacation. After all, it isn’t like Luigi’s history of misadventures with certain mansions will repeat itself, right?

 

If only he knew.

 
Taking big brother Mario, Princess Peach, three Toads and even Polterpup along on his dream vacation, Luigi soon finds out that it was all a clever ruse by the hotel’s owner Hellen Gravely to appease King Boo. With Mario, Princess Peach and the trio of Toads gone and trapped inside old age paintings, it’s up to Luigi to save his brother and friends - and he’s up to the task even if it is full of scary twists and turns.

 

With the help of his trustworthy Poltergust G-00, Luigi takes on the task of saving his family and friends in a world of panic. As Luigi’s guiding light, you need to lead the younger sibling of the Mario Bros. duo through various floors of the haunted hotel. Along the way, you are encountered by various Boos, Ghosts, and traps - which you need to navigate your way through at all costs.

 

Apart from playing as Luigi, you can also switch as his green doppelganger Gooigi, who can change shapes and get past obstacles such as spikes or tight spaces that the cowardly-yet-heroic Luigi cannot. This new ability, which is provided to our reluctant hero by Professor E. Gadd, opens doors to a lot of fun and helps you get through obstacles in more than one way.

 

But that’s not all. Since Luigi’s Mansion, 3 is a family-friendly game, it also allows a multiplayer mode where you can play with a family member or a friend while choosing between Luigi and Gooigi. You can also play the ScareScraper mode, a timed version of various rounds to see who fares the best against various obstacles to score some well-deserved bragging rights. The ScareScraper mode can be played by up to 8 players, which can either be connected online or locally via four Nintendo Switch consoles controlled by two players each.

 

{{ sn-link }} offers various themed floors to play with, which are all decorated meticulously according to their chosen aesthetic. For instance, while you can enjoy the selection of food that’s found on the mezzanine floor, you can also benefit from the visuals that the hotel shops have to offer at another level. Various creatures live through each floor and provide you with various fun challenges to make your way through in a very thrilling and exciting manner.

 

If you are a fan of the previous titles in the Luigi’s Mansion series, then this particular offering would not disappoint you even if you hold high expectations from it. Luigi’s new abilities in this piece of the franchise include Slam, Suction Shot and Burst attacks. He can also defeat ghosts by slamming them into other ghosts. The addition of Gooigi as a playable character only adds more value to the game.

 

According to users, {{ sn-link }} is a very fun game to play that comes with an exciting story-line, immersive graphics, and enjoyable game-play. Users have noted that the game is fit to be played by children and adults alike, where it provides them with an equal amount of enjoyment against each playing session.

According to users, {{ sn-link }} does not only hold all the redeeming qualities of the original title and its sequel, but it makes them better - which is a feat that many users are pleasantly surprised and very glad about.

 

Some users take issue with the amount of time they have to put up with before starting multiplayer mode. But others mention that they do not see it as an issue but the part of the game-play since the option to play the multiplayer ScareScraper mode is always there.
