A tool kit, sewing kit, and first aid kit are all necessities in any household. You may not need them right now, but you’ll certainly do at some point. This is somewhat of an unspoken rule everybody subconsciously learned growing up. Lately, with everyone and their grandma having a ton of devices, having a good repair kit has quickly started to become one of those necessities. You never know when one of your devices will break down and you must fix it. Perhaps you want to replace your phone screen or reattach loose components inside a gaming console (both things I’ve had to do just this year). Even if your devices never break (*they will*) you might need to assemble something like a custom-built PC. Whatever the case may be, having a repair kit is a no-brainer.

Personally I’ve been using a [repair kit from iFixit](https://www.amazon.com/iFixit-Pro-Tech-Toolkit-Electronics/dp/B01GF0KV6G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Pro%27s+kit&qid=1565873996&s=gateway&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=8e0008b07dcac72597d418b46d799704&language=en_US) since 2015 and I’ve been super happy with it… until a couple of days ago when I stumbled upon the [***Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver and Repair Kit***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&language=en_US). It’s an ***electric screwdriver repair kit*** with an incredibly stylish design. I. Need. This. In. My. Life.

### The Screwdriver

The [***Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&language=en_US) is an electric screwdriver. But not one of those big electric screwdrivers made for building that you’re probably thinking of. This tool is made specifically for device repair. Because of this it doesn’t have to be any larger than your average whiteboard pencil. Unlike any other tool that you put away after use and then have to dig up when you need it, the [***Ruputas Wowstick 1F+***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&language=en_US) has such a sleek, modern design that you might as well leave it on your desk as decoration. In-fact, since *Ruputas* include an equally stylish stand for the tool I’m pretty sure that’s what they intend for you to do.

But, let’s be honest. You’re probably not buying an electric screwdriver for the looks. You’re buying it because of its usefulness. So, how good is the [***Ruputas Wowstick 1F+***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&language=en_US)? It has a rated speed of 200rpm and a rated torque of 0.15/3N.M which basically translates to: it’s definitely powerful enough. On top of that, the tip of the tool is equipped with three LED lights which means there’s no need to try get that stupidly far in screw out while simultaneously trying to balance your phone with flashlight on between your chin and chest because the light won’t reach. No, I’m not still salty from the last time this happened. Not at all.

To top it all off the tool is not only useful, powerful, and stylish but also incredibly easy to use. Just pick it up, slip in the bit (or *screwhead* as some insist on calling them) and you’re good to go. There’s only one key for you to press. Pressing the bottom part of it will rotate the bit forwards and pressing the top part rotates it back. Now, I’m really only mentioning this because *Ruputas* lists this as one of their selling points but, honestly, have you ever seen an electric screwdriver that isn’t this easy to use?

Moving on, the screwdriver itself isn’t the only thing you get with this product…

### But wait! There’s more…

That’s right. Besides getting the screwdriver itself, you’ll get an entire repair kit with everything you’ll ever need. Let’s go through what’s in the box.

Right upon opening the box you’ll be greeted with a *magnetic mat* that you can put your screws on to prevent them from rolling away. I cannot stress enough how useful having something like this is. I remember the first time I built a PC and lost more than half the screws because they discretely rolled away. Guess what, I never found them either. Since then I’ve learned my lesson and now I use the good old bowl trick. The problem with putting all the screws in a bowl is that they all get mixed together and it’s difficult to find the screw you need. Placing them flat on a magnetic surface makes it much easier to stay organized when repairing and you won’t need to chase fleeing screws.

After removing the magnetic mat you’ll find the screwdriver itself, the stand for the screwdriver, and the other accessories perfectly arranged. Like Tetris blocks. What are these other accessories? As I said, it’s practically all the tools you need in a repair kit. You’ve got a suction cup, a guitar-pick-shaped pry tool and a magnetizer / demagnetizer tool. You’ll also get a storage case where you can throw accessories into when you’re not using them, or you could use it as a traveling case.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “That’s cool and all but wouldn’t the screwdriver be useless without bits (screwheads)”? You’re right, it would. That’s why the screwdriver comes with a whopping **56 bits**. That’s more than you’ll probably ever need. I’m looking through the list now (which you can find in the Amazon description) and I honestly don’t even know what all of these are. And I’ve done my fair share repairs. They come in three super neat storage tubes that look more practical and definitely takes up less space than the rectangular boxes they tend to come with.

Of course, you’ll also receive a charging cable.

### What are other people saying?

Looking at the Amazon reviews, customers seem to be satisfied with the product. They’ve been praising the design and the practically of the device as well as the include accessories. It seems like the most praised aspects (except the convenience factor) of the kit is the included magnetic mat, the LED lights on the tip of the screwdriver, and the sheer number of bits included in the box.

The only real complaint about the product itself I could find was that some feel it is underpower. They want to tighten screws harder than the motor is capable of. Personally, I think this is by design. Quite often when dealing with sensitive components you don’t want to tighten the screws too hard because that could cause damage. Therefore, the screwdriver tightens hard enough for most cases and if you want it to be extra tight then you need to tighten it more manually. That being said, I’ve seen several reviews of the device as well as [videos where the device has been used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSBFCx59fF8) and it looks like the screwdriver will be able to tighten screws hard enough in 99% of cases.

Another complain I’ve seen is the fact that the device charges using Micro USB instead of USB-C and… yeah that sucks. But in all honesty, it doesn’t really matter. It fully charges in 40 minutes anyway. My Kindle and Bluetooth speakers all charge using Micro USB and while it is slightly annoying having to have an extra cable for devices like this, you’ll get used to it.

One odd quirk I haven’t seen mentioned in any reviews is the fact that the stand for the screwdriver doesn’t charge it. It’s just a stand. Again, it’s just a minor inconvenience and doesn’t make it any less of an amazing tool but it’s odd and worth mentioning.

### Conclusion

Having a repair kit at home for all your devices is quickly becoming as much of a necessity as having a tool kit, sewing kit, and first aid kit. The [***Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver and Repair Kit***](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=reviewhuntr-20&linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&language=en_US) is seemingly the perfect one. Not only do you get and extremely stylish electric screwdriver, but you also get essential repair tools as well as 56 different bits (screwheads).

I highly recommend picking this kit up. Even if you don’t need it now you *will* need it in the future. Best to be prepared.
