Ah, the coffee mug. It has been a tried and true friend. It is always there for us. It is always waiting in the mornings to help us get ready for the day. The cycle of its waiting then continues until the next use, whether it comes in the form of a midday caffeine shot or as a little pick me up in the evening. In each instance of its usage, the traditional coffee mug does not disappoint.

  

But we live in a world of innovation and progress. We are turning everything smart. So why not turn the coffee mug smart too? That is what the {{ sn-link }} coffee mug creators thought - or at least, I think that is what they thought - while making the product.

  

You can find the {{ sn-link }} Smart Coffee Mug on Amazon, at the Apple Store or even Starbucks. They are practically everywhere. But you are likely to get the best deal and customer experience on Amazon. Now, the original mug has been out for a while, which is why we are covering its second version, the {{ sn-link }} Smart Coffee Mug 2.

  

The {{ sn-link }} Smart Coffee Mug 2 has become very popular, which is mostly because of its temperature control qualities. This is all thanks to the mug’s heat plate, which warms up liquids between 120°F - 145°F. People love it mostly because of this ability since it can heat up on the spot and keep the coffee warm for at least one hour. That’s the main value of this new and improved coffee mug.

  

Why? Well, because most of us are often cursed with the lukewarm coffee. As a professional in today’s modern world, you may sit down to enjoy your freshly made coffee, only to get an urgent call in the morning from your workplace. Do you work as a tech expert? Great, the servers might be down. Do you have a career in the healthcare industry? There might be patient issues that cannot be addressed over the phone. If you are a parent, then you may have to tend to your children and get them ready for school in the morning. And if you are just like more than half the population, then you might be running too late for work or school to finish your coffee.

  

Whatever the case may be, it is easy to sacrifice the warmth of a freshly made coffee pot in the morning. But no more! Thanks to the {{ sn-link }} Coffee Mug 2, people can enjoy the warmth of coffee without any hassles. With the coffee mug, you can keep your coffee warm for longer than before. It is very useful for many different occasions, but especially for when you are in the deepest parts of the winter season.

  

For those times when you find yourself at home due to hazardous conditions outside and need to keep warm while enjoying a wonderful Hallmark movie or the latest audiobook by John Grisham, the {{ sn-link }} Coffee Mug 2 can keep your beverage warm for you. But as with all new technologies and enhancements to traditional items, this will come at a slightly higher price than your traditional mug.

  

To give you an idea, an {{ sn-link }} Coffee Mug 2 will run you around $129.00. You can see why many may deem it as a luxury and purchase the item as such. Some may go as far as to buy it as a gift for the avid coffee drinker in their lives to show that they care about them. But from what can be judged by actual user reviews, the purchase might prove to be worth it if you enjoy your coffee like anything.

  

Now the first thing that users love about the cup is that it is nice to look at. According to users, the creators did an amazing job designing the {{ sn-link }} Coffee Mug 2. The design boasts of the right shape and curves in all the right places, making it very pleasing to the eye. But that is not all. Users also note that it is ergonomic with a robust handle, which makes it fit right in their hands. The touch and feel of the whole cup is also great because it is made of stainless steel and overlaid with scratch-resistant ceramic coating. This means that the cup cannot only hold your beverage hot for a long time, but it also makes it quite difficult for you to spill it even when you are too immersed in your holiday movie or enthusiastic about socializing with family. In other words, its simplicity makes it luxurious in both utility and design.

  

The {{ link }} 2 comes with an impressive battery life. To be precise, it can run for 80 minutes on a single charge. With the charging coaster, it can go on all day. Users have noted that the battery life falls around the specified time, which is quite a positive point for those on the go.

  

The mug is also controllable with its own {{ sn-link }} App, which is available for mobile devices. You can set your temperature, receive notifications and tweak around different settings. The mug also comes with an auto-sleep feature, which allows is to turn itself off once it senses that it’s empty. It also wakes up automatically when it senses movement.

  

A few users have noted that the handle itself might have a sharp profile and may have a different feel than traditional coffee mug handles. But this observation remains limited to a small section of users. With that, users have also noted that you can get only about eight ounces in a single pour of coffee from the cup due to its design. On the other hand, regular cups can hold more coffee in one go. With that being said, most users are not taken aback by that fact. This just means that if you are big coffee drinker, you will have to make do with more than a single serving into the cup to get your morning fix.

  

## Conclusion

All in all, the {{ sn-link }} Coffee Mug 2 is said to last longer, is app-controlled, has auto sleep to preserve battery life and comes with a warranty when purchased with Amazon. Users also love the fact that it is hand washable.
