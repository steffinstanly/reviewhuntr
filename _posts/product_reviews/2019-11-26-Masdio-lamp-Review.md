Those of us who like their personal space to be neat and tidy have a challenge ahead of us at bedtime. No matter how much we try, we now have to deal with an endless tangle of cords and wires every night, thanks to our multimedia needs and our modern mobile devices that seem hungry for getting charged through the dark.


If you have a pedantic personality with a penchant to keep everything around you in order, then this mess of wires every night may give you nightmares even before you sleep. But thanks to modern devices, you no longer have to go through the chaos of cords every day. With devices such as the {{ link }}, you can enjoy wireless connectivity as you get ready for some well deserved sweet dreams - and you can do so in a very luxurious manner.

The Masdio by Ampulla lamp promises to meet your most crucial needs, taking all the responsibility off of your shoulders to soothe you into a relaxing sleep. Built-in a “Tree of Life” style, the lamp comes in a cherry wood shade that covers its lamp dome over a black base and a silver tree trunk design. Made out of wood and plastic, the lamp also boasts of a Qi-certified wireless charger that can provide power to all modern devices that support the technology.

 

If you thought that those features were more than enough for a bedside lamp, you might need to rethink that conclusion. It’s because the {{ sn-link }} also comes with a wireless speaker to play your favorite tunes or audiobooks as you get ready for bed. Powered by Bluetooth 4.0, the wireless speaker plays all kinds of music swiftly and clearly, delivering a sound quality that is fit to help you feel relaxed and calm in an instant - all without having to deal with a tangle of wires.

 
The {{ sn-link }} also comes with a seamless touch dimmer that’s located at the side. This means that instead of having to find clunky knobs or buttons, you can simply slide your fingers over the lamp to adjust the light according to your liking. The touch panel also allows you to turn the lamp on or off with a simple tap. But there’s more to this touch panel: you can also make use of the Good Night Mood mode that initially dims the light and then turns it off after 30 minutes. This ensures that you are not wasting energy even if you take some time to doze off or can’t sleep without having a book in your hands.

 

The lamp comes with a bark lampshade, which does not only have the durability of cherry wood but also has its natural, calming and soothing scent. The Bluetooth speaker is built at the top and center of the lampshade, housing the lamp’s 38 LED lights under the wood and plastic covering. The white outline design that surrounds the black speaker on top of the lampshade creates a surreal lighting effect, making the bedside lamp just as much as a sight for sore eyes as a multifunctional device.

 

The lamp boasts of the dimensions of 13.1 x 9.1 x 7.6 inches, which makes it just tall enough to stand out over your bedside table without being too garish in its size. It weighs about 3.53 lbs, which gives it a steady hold at the surface of your table and makes it difficult to be knocked off by mischievous cats or overexcited kids.

 

The LED lamp is powered through an AC supply and has a wattage of 20 watts. Using it as easy as plugging it into its power supply, and turning it on and off through the given controls. You can connect your primary devices to the Bluetooth speaker easily, and the wireless charging works by placing your phone on top of the designated spot that’s built right under the lampshade.

 

When it comes to using the device on a day to day basis, users sing praises of its functionality. According to users, the 200 Lumens brightness of the lamp provides plenty of light. But the cherry wood lamp shade coupled with the white outline makes sure that the light isn’t jarring to the eyes. Users have also noted that the light can be dimmed easily through the sliding panel, which works as intended and doesn’t provide any issues with its function.

 

According to users, the Bluetooth 4.0 technology makes it easier to connect their devices to the speaker, which by itself delivers a fantastic sound that booms through the reflection of the wooden lampshade. Users have noted that the sound is also easily adjustable through the playback device or through the lamp itself. Almost all users of the lamp agree that the sound quality of the lamp’s speaker remains exceptional and makes the device stand out from other gadgets in its class.

 

Other than that, users have also noted positive comments regarding the look of the lamp itself. According to users, the lamp has a premium finish and stands out in the bedroom like a luxury item, elevating the look of their overall surroundings. The lighting of the lamp further enhances this effect and makes sure that users seem proud of their purchase.

 

When it comes to wireless charging, users have noted that it works as it is supposed to and frees them from the hassle of handling charging cords. Since the lamp’s wireless charging pad is Qi-certified, it can charge almost all modern and high-end devices without any issues. Users have noted that wireless charging does heat their phones a little bit, but that is a regular instance whenever you are charging your mobile devices wirelessly.

 

A limited number of users have noted that the cherry wood lampshade seems like plastic to them. But other users have simply mentioned their love for the material and how it seems what is described by the company.


At $129.95, the Masdio by Ampulla fulfills its purpose as a multifunctional device. While it is a bedside lamp, it is more than just a light and makes sure that not only its design tells you of that fact, but that its overall usage makes it stand out from a plethora of similar lamps.
