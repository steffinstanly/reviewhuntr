Regardless of where we hail from, we all have a certain sense of curiosity about our ancestry. While only a very few people might take an interest in mythical, archaeological or political history, almost all of us find our specific roots to be fascinating. Up until a few years ago, we did not have the needed access to this type of information. But thanks to the advancements in technology, the times are changing and we have services from companies such as {{ link }} that help us learn about our roots.

The {{ link }} Health + Ancestry Service for personal genetic DNA test might be a great gift during these holidays for your loved ones, friends, and acquaintances. It is a tool that is effective in more ways than one since it can help people learn about their ancestors, point out health predispositions, and help them maintain overall wellness in life.

 
With {{ link }}, you can access over 150 total reports and features that include but are not limited to DNA relative finder, automatic family tree builder, ancestry reports, trait reports, health predisposition reports, carrier status reports, and wellness reports.

Users have noted that this makes {{ link }} quite a fascinating service since it helps you connect to the wonders of the universe while also allowing you to improve your life in the present.

  

One of the reasons why I find {{ link }} and its services fascinating is because it was one of the first entities to make the process so simple. Let’s find out more about the company’s services and how they work.

  

{{ link }}’s ancestry component is one of the biggest features for people who are interested in learning more about themselves and their familial lines. If you are interested in your ancestry composition, you would find {{ link }} to be the product for you. The kit can help capture your information in a super-easy way. From there, {{ link }} can translate that information to show your ancestry history. According to users, this is by far the biggest selling point of the product and its relevant services. Users have noted that they like the product because it helped them connect to the world in a never seen before way, and assisted them in becoming a part of something greater. But most of all, it is the ease of use that makes this greater purpose so simple to fulfill.

  

Another prominent feature of the {{ link }} test pertains to health, where people can understand and know more about their genes. This study tells you about your gene structure, and this knowledge can help you control and minimize interactions with foods and substances that are unhealthy for your particular DNA structure. Your genetic history can help you prepare for the challenges that your body may face in the future, giving you the chance to prevent issues by making lifestyle changes. Some of the reports that come out of the test include findings regarding diabetes type 2, Alzheimer's, and celiac disease. {{ link }} also provides information that is relevant to your potential children and how you may impact their future. Users have noted this to be a very helpful feature as well.

  

Yet another fascinating aspect of life is to understand more about the origination of traits that you cannot explain. {{ link }} can help you understand more about the foods you love, the scents you adore, and the preferences you show towards certain things over others. This fun and captivating way of learning about your own body is another reason why {{ link }} is so sought after by its users.

  

{{ link }} is also promised the utmost privacy protections. The company states that your data is “encrypted, protected, and under your control”. This aspect of privacy is very important in a day and age where people are the product on some platforms. Users have noted that they have been satisfied with the level of assurance they have received from {{ link }} on protecting their private data.

  
  

Users have noted that they receive a plastic kit, a sheet of instructions, a plastic biohazard bag, a small cube tab and a sample collection tube. Many users have commented that it is vital to keep the cover because that is what you use to send the sample back to the {{ link }} lab. Users also talk about the importance of registering the specific kit to make sure to get the right results.

  

Other users have noted that the simplicity of getting the results. Since the final results are present within your account on {{ link }}.com, you can access them easily without having to physically visit a lab. Each kit has a unique barcode that you can use to register your account, which once again plays a big part in information security.

  

{{ link }} states that it is “the first and only genetic service available directly to you that includes reports that meet FDA requirements for clinical and scientific validity. All saliva samples are processed in CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited labs.” Meeting FDA requirements is a big deal and helps to show users that the service is interested in providing a compelling value for current and potential users.

  

A very few users have commented that the {{ link }} lab may not be able to process saliva from every single individual. But this doesn't seem to be the case for a majority of the user base, who are happy with the timing pertaining to their particular health results.

  

Now for one of my favorite parts about this intriguing product.
