According to users, the headphones also live up to delivering the level of sound clarity that they claim.

Another compelling feature of the {{ link }} is that of RemoteTalk, which is exclusive to iOS devices. There is a non-detachable cable attached to your headphones that facilitates RemoteTalk and other actions.

RemoteTalk allows users to adjust the volume by simply pressing the top button to increase the volume and the bottom button to decrease it.

 

The remote also accounts for calls. You can easily use RemoteTalk to answer or end a call by pressing the middle button. If you are too busy to take a call, you can press down on the center button for two seconds and release to decline the said call. You can turn to RemoteTalk to place a call on hold. You can even use voice commands by pressing the center button and summon Siri through it. Of course, you can also use the remote to control your media to play and pause your music and videos. According to users, these features make it quite easy to use the {{ link }}. These features are largely accessible to those that have iOS devices, but most of them are also available for Android users.

 

Users also note that these headphones do not fold. That is an important point for those who are used to folding their devices and keeping them safely stored away for later use. Other users have noted minor issues with the foam coating wearing out after their headphones were used excessively and put through various weather conditions. But as a counterpoint, other users have mentioned that their headphones have lasted for more than two years, which is a great value for money for such a pair of headphones.
