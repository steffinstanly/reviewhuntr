What is one thing that you cannot live without these days? If you thought of your cell phone as the immediate answer, you probably share that in common with millions of people around the world. After all, most of us have cultivated the habit of turning to our devices first thing in the morning and checking the weather or applications such as TikTok to have a laugh or three.

  

Thanks to the advancements of technology, your phone isn’t limited to letting you make calls or send texts. It is there to make you laugh. It is there to help you work. And it is there to let you unwind during stressful times. Simply put, your phone is always with you to help you with your needs. That’s why you like many others make sure to keep your phone with you all the time. The fact that you paid good money for it only adds to this notion of keeping your expensive phone as close to you as possible.

  

But there’s one problem with you carrying your phone everywhere you go.

  

Germs, germs, and more germs!

  

These nasty little microbes are everywhere. They don’t discriminate between animate or inanimate objects. They infest everything and anything that you can lay our hands or even your eyes on. That means that you can easily pick up and place dozens and dozens of germs on your phone every single day. That is certainly a big problem which can cause many different issues, especially in times of cold, flu, and other viral diseases.

  

So what are you to do?

  

Resort to touching your phone only at certain times? Minimizing your interaction with your device? Wearing gloves and hoping they work with your phone’s touchscreen? None of that sounds so doable in a time where your phone is essential to your everyday needs.

  

A better solution would be to use the {{ link }}. Clinically proven to sanitize modern smartphones with the utmost care, it serves you well and obliterates 99.99% of germs on your device quite easily.

  

With the {{ sn-link }}, you can say goodbye to bacteria in just a few easy steps. What I like about the {{ sn-link }} is that this product is not a novelty item, but an actual necessity in this day and age. We use our phones frequently throughout the day, but we usually do not realize the germ or bacteria transfer that takes place with regular use. As the manufacturer describes, our phones are 18x dirtier than a toilet. That’s gross, I know. But it’s also true. That’s why, when it comes to protecting yourself against the side effects of germs harbored by your phone, using a tool such as the {{ sn-link }} seems to be a very good idea.

  

Interested to learn more about the {{ sn-link }}? Here are a couple of things you will need to know about this product before you go ahead with purchasing it.

  

First, the {{ sn-link }} uses germicidal UV-C bulbs to clean your devices. UV-C is scientifically proven to kill germs, which speaks for the efficacy of the {{ sn-link }} right off the bat. While the device’s name refers to it as a “soap”, it doesn’t require you to use any sort of liquid or foam to clean your phone. It works as a small case with built-in UV-C bulbs. Simply put your phone inside the sleek-looking gadget, and get it cleaned in a hassle-free way. If you don’t want to walk around touching a device that may harbor stapp, e.coli, and other bacteria that are harmful to your health, then this product claims to be the right fit for you.

  

The {{ sn-link }} is available in different colors including black, white, silver, gold, orchid, aqua, periwinkle, and lilac. It boasts the dimensions of 8 x 6 x 2 inches, with its inner dimensions to fit phones specified as 6.8 x 3.74 x 0.78 inches. This means that the device can clean most modern smartphones such as the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with ease. But that’s not all, as long as any other of your items can fit into the {{ sn-link }}, you can get it cleaned without any issues. This includes remotes, credit cards, and keys among many other items. Users have noted that the overall look and the device neutral approach of the {{ sn-link }} adds value to its price point.

  

Second, the {{ sn-link }} is more than a phone sanitizer. That’s right. Apart from cleaning your devices, it also serves as a power bank or remote charger by offering a USB port and a USB-C port. You like most other users might love the fact that this tool will charge a wide variety of smart devices ranging from the iPhone to your favorite Android devices. According to users, this ability to sanitize your phone and charge it at the same time adds another useful feature to {{ sn-link }} and allows the device to serve more than the purpose of cleaning. This effectively encourages them to carry the device around with them without it feeling like an added burden.

  

The {{ sn-link }} was made famous by Shark Tank and has been featured on other platforms such as Good Morning America and QVC. The Discovery Channel even did a segment on the tool and found its claims to be true. This means that the device has gone through fire in terms of scrutiny and has still come out the other end unscathed. Users have noted that the device works exactly as it is supposed to, remains easy to use, and looks good while sanitizing their phones.

  

But a few users have noted that they faced issues with their device in the sense that it stopped working after a few months. With that being said, a large number of users seems quite content with their purchase and how it provided them with the peace of mind they were looking for.

  

At $79.95, most users seem happy with the overall offering of the {{ sn-link }} and sing praises of it left, right and center. The device is also a best-seller at Amazon, which highlights its popularity among its target audience.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ sn-link }} works as intended. With clinically proven results and value-added features to boot, the device will be ideal for you if you are one to believe in preventative care while also being up to date with the latest technology. Since the device has a cool design and looks futuristic, it is stylish enough to fit at your desk with your other modern equipment.
