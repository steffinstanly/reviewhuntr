You probably already know that about 70% of the Earth is covered by water. You might also realize that 60% of our body is also made up of H2O. The fact of the matter is that water is important for all kinds of life. It is one of the most vital components of every single cell in our body.

 
While that is interesting in itself, what’s even more curious is how we never take a moment to stop and think about the crucial role water truly plays in our lives. Take this, for instance. You can live without food for at least three weeks, but you can only go without water for three days.

  

Pretty crazy right?

  

Yes, staying hydrated helps you to become a better you. Whether it’s about oral health and helping you minimize bad breath and cavities, or if it’s about physical wellbeing and improving your cardiovascular functions, water is essential to a better quality of life. Adequate water intake helps regulate your body’s temperature and keeps your skin in excellent condition. But water doesn’t just impact your body, it also affects your brain positively. That’s why health professionals always recommend you to drink water when you are out and about on the town and consuming alcohol.

  

But the fact is that many of us forget to drink water or ignore the essential requirement to consume it regularly. Just like flossing, running, or performing other activities that are helpful to our body but not 100% necessary, we forgo drinking an adequate amount of water regularly.

  

If only there was some sort of reminder, technology or device that would allow us to remember that we have to drink water regularly.

  

Well, after a little scouring and searching on Amazon, I have found the ICEWATER 3 in 1 Smart Stainless Steel Water Bottle. Available for $21.99, the bottle doesn’t only store your water, but it glows to remind you to keep hydrated. What’s even cooler is that it changes colors every hour to motivate you to take a quick sip of water before you forget about it.

  

The {{ sn-link }} can keep your water cold for up to 24 hours and maintain its hot temperature for up to 12 hours. It is also made out of food-grade stainless steel and remains 100 percent BPA-free. It is available in three colors: black, blue, and pink. With the ability to hold 20 oz water, the bottle remains quite useful for those who want a portable option to carry around a noticeable supply of fresh and safe water at all times.

  

The bottle’s dimensions are in its 2.7 x 2.7 x 9.7 inches. But it promises to make handling easier due to its ergonomic and user-friendly design. Users have noted that the bottle keeps their water cold or hot throughout the day and goes beyond their expectations in terms of quality. It is also very easy to hold on to and light to carry around.

  

The wonderful goodness of this {{ sn-link }} does not end there. Users can enjoy a wireless Bluetooth speaker within the bottle. This makes for the second feature in the 3 in 1 bottle. The Bluetooth speaker connects directly to your phone or computer and streams music through your chosen device. The speaker is also water-resistant, which ensures that you can use and refill your bottle without any fear of damaging this value-added feature. With its 600mAh battery, the speaker is rechargeable through USB, which means that you don’t have to use any external batteries to enjoy its music streaming features. It also boasts of a resonance bass design, which makes it provide additional bass when the bottle is placed on a wooden surface.

  

According to users, the sound quality of the Bluetooth speaker remains quite great. Users have noted that the speaker can pack a punch and deliver loud and clear sound, which means that you can play your music outdoors with the assurance that it wouldn’t die down amid the sounds of your surroundings. If you are not one to play loud sounds in public or even in your home, then you can simply not connect your phone or computer to the Bluetooth speaker. Users have noted that this ability to use the speaker at will makes the bottle quite a great choice for people of all temperaments.

  

Now, for the third feature in the {{ link }}: the dancing lights. The lights do not only glow in the dark and every hour to remind you about your water, but they also provide a dancing lights effect. You can easily turn the dancing lights mode on and off. Users have noted that they like the bottle’s music playing effects, where its strobe lights sort of design goes right along with the music that you are listening to. With that being said, the lights don’t look gaudy. Since they are placed at the bottom of the bottle, they simply reflect on the surface where you place your bottle. This makes the water bottle a fun item to carry around while also fulfilling your resolution to adopt healthier lifestyle choices - all without the bottle looking like a prank prop.

  

A limited number of users have said that the blinking light feature did not work as the reminder that they thought it would be. According to them, if you are not looking at the bottle, you will not be able to catch the reminder light every hour. Whereas, a majority of users remains quite happy with the lights and how they work.

  

## Conclusion

Since the holiday season makes for the perfect time for gifts, buying one of these inexpensive yet highly functional bottles and gifting it to your loved ones can help them be a better version of themselves.

  

All in all, the {{ sn-link }} is great for everyone ranging from your parents to your friends and peers and can help them adopt a healthier lifestyle in a fun way.
