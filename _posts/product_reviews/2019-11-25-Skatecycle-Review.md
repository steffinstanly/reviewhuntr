You and I are always interested in a wide variety of hobbies. Why? Because life would be bland without them. I mean, who wants to focus on just one thing all day and have no color in life? Life brings about a tapestry, a cornucopia, and a spectrum of different activities for us to participate in and add more value to our sense of purpose.

  

Since most modern jobs are all about working on a desk, most of us love activities that help us move around. That’s why we appreciate basketball, football, ice hockey, or other indoor or outdoor activities that facilitate movement in any way. One such past time people like you and I may indulge in is that of skateboarding.

  

Skateboarding brings about a whole culture of popular figures such as Tony Hawk and Tony Alva as the leaders of this sport, instilling inspiration and the sense of achieving great things through the medium. The action sport is thrilling and exciting due to how it requires one to have control of their board on wheels while also enjoying themselves to the hilt. It is not only a fun sport, but it is also significantly adventurous.

  

Much like other sports, skateboarding started with a niche audience and then grew into a much larger phenomenon. Today, the sport holds many brands that have added value to it and who continue contributing to its larger popularity on a global scale.

  

Skateboarding is interesting because it brings about many different benefits such as improved fitness, increased stamina, dynamic traits, and faster reflexes. Most importantly, it encourages the resilience to fall and get back on your feet - or on that board to be precise. Of course, the added benefits which include a reduction in stress and the ability to hang out with friends only make it all the more exciting.

  

Products such as the Freerider {{ link }} help you be a part of this global phenomenon. Not only can you go ahead and make sure that you are practising your advanced skills in a fun way, but you can do so with an exciting piece of equipment that you may have never used before.

  

Built for advanced skateboarders, the {{ link }} comes in the form of an unconventional skateboard. To be specific, the {{ link }} is a self-propelled hubless skate that’s built-in an unconventional design. It is meant to help you advance your deep carving skills, with the non-traditional style making things even more exciting during your training. While the {{ link }} is not meant for beginners, the manufacturer claims that anyone with the basic skills to ride a skateboard, caster board and even a snowboard can easily learn to steer the {{ link }}.

  

The {{ link }}’s design allows you to step your feet within the center of the wheels, and steer your new equipment as an amalgamation of a skateboard and a mini-cycle-without-handlebars. This is also where it gets its name. With 9-inch wheels on either side, the {{ link }} can be ridden on flat ground, and can also be taken to most skating ramps. According to the manufacturer, this makes the equipment fit for the streets and your favorite skating parks alike.

  

Due to this multipurpose utility, the {{ link }} is made in a way that allows you to fold it easily. With 7.3 lbs of weight, it is quite light to carry around from place to place. According to users, the rubber finish of the large wheels makes it easier to steer the {{ link }}. But at the same time, riding this equipment is a skill that takes some time to master. For some users, the challenge is actually the highlighting part of the {{ link }}, since it allows them to hone their skateboarding skills through a completely new piece of equipment.

  

According to users, learning to ride the {{ link }} is a fun activity that will keep most people occupied with yet another goal during their training. Users have also noted that the {{ link }}’s overall speed isn’t intended to be very fast, which makes sense to most of the people who have ridden the equipment due to its overall steering and stopping mechanisms.

  

Users have commented that steering the {{ link }} requires you to have command of your whole bodyweight, which ensures that you can manoeuvre and stop it through the force of your feet. With that being said, if you are using the {{ link }} over a slope, then users recommend that you watch your speed since it provides you with some thrilling stats in terms of acceleration.

  

The {{ link }} is built with durability in mind, which is something that’s noted by most users who sing praises of the equipment’s overall construction and material. Some users do take issue with how difficult it can be to master the {{ link }}, while others just find it a part of its charm. Most users have noted that while riding the {{ link }} requires a lot of practice, it provides plenty of opportunities to improve their deep carving skills while also offering a great and fun workout.

  

The {{ link }} is available in a black color. Due to its innovative design and a subversive approach to skateboarding training, the equipment has won the Bronze 2010 IDEA Award. At 32 x 6.5 x 8.5 inches, the {{ link }} can fit several skateboarders, and provide them with the chance to have fun with what the equipment brings to the table.

  

The {{ link }} can be purchased from Amazon at the price of $99. If you or a loved one enjoy skateboarding, then this might just be the perfect purchase for the holiday season. Of course, the fact that you can use it all year round in outdoor and indoor facilities only adds to its value for money.

  

## Conclusion

All in all, the {{ link }} is a fun, challenging and non-traditional piece of equipment for those who like skateboarding and enjoy spicing up their training routines every now and then. If you are not taken aback by a piece of challenging equipment, then the {{ link }} has the potential to be one of your favorite sports purchases of all time.
