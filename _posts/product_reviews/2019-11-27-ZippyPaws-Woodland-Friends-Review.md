If you own a dog, then you would agree that there’s nothing in this world that you wouldn’t do for them. Whether you have kids of your own or not, your doggo proves to be your baby and you won’t hear anything that someone has to say about it. Well, that’s exactly the way you should be, since these adorable pups deserve nothing but the absolute best love and commitment from us that they provide to us with all their heart.

  

That is why we do our best to make sure that our little fur babies are happy in their home. We build their beds, we take them to vets, and we ensure to fill our house with all the safety and joy that we want for ourselves. With this in mind, when we see a toy that brings unadulterated happiness to our dogs, we make sure to get them without wasting a second.

  

The {{ link }} Squeaky Toy is one such item that promises to bring hours and hours of joy for your goofy best friend. Built-in a log design that comes with not one, not two, but three squeaky chipmunks, it is a pleasant looking toy that is sure to tickle your dog’s playfulness.

  

The {{ sn-link }} toy is designed to be enjoyed by small and large dogs alike, which is why it boasts of the dimensions of 14 x 6 x 6 inches. Its design makes it stand out from the generic bone style of most toys, while also ensuring that it appeals to your dog due to its playful imagery.

  

But the {{ sn-link }} toy is not just there to sit and look pretty to your dog (since, you know, they cannot see color as we do). Since it is meant to be a squeaky toy, the chipmunks comes with a distinct sound that can be enjoyed by your furball whenever they play with them. With that, it also acts as an interactive toy that’s challenging enough for your dog to remain interested, while also simple enough for them to enjoy playing with it.

  

According to ZippyPaws, all you have to do is hide the perky chipmunks into the log design and show your dog how to get them out. That is it, your pup will then jump onto the toy like a duck on a June bug. You can keep hiding the chipmunks back into the log each time your dog finds them, or you can let them play on their own. Since the log design has three holes for the chipmunks to hide in, you can ensure at least a few minutes of play with even the most curious of dogs. ZippyPaw promises that the chew toy has been designed with materials that ensure your dog’s teeth or oral health will not be compromised even after hours and hours of play. Specifically, the material used in the log design is fabric, which makes the ZippyPaw log a plush toy that’s gentle on your dog’s teeth and jaw. As a result, it is perfect for teething pups and playful grown-ups alike.

  

According to users, the {{ link }} does exactly what it claims to do and indeed provides a lot of fun to intriguing dogs. Users have noted that their small and large dogs alike loved the feel of the plush log as well as the squeaky chipmunks, and played with it for hours on end. Users have noted that the squeaky toys have a fun sound to them, which was something that was enjoyed by their pets.

  

Users have also noted that the plushy feel of the {{ link }} has encouraged their dogs to bring the toy to their bed. Many users have commented that the burrow became their dog’s favorite plush toy right after its arrival. Other users have noted that the log has remained intact with their smaller dogs, who have continued using the toy months after it was ordered for them.

  

Users have noted that the toy is very well made and looks adorable especially against their dogs. Some users comment that it is great for pictures, which is mostly because their puppy looks so happy next to the toy. Most users recommend the toy for other pet owners and mention that it is the perfect size for many breeds.

  

According to users, the {{ link }} is perfect for small to medium-sized dogs if you are looking for durability with the toy. But with larger dogs who are a bit aggressive with their toys, the material of the chipmunks can get torn within a few days. With that being said, users have mentioned that the chipmunks can be ordered separately, and the amount of fun their dogs have with the toy just encourages them to order more chipmunks without any frown on their face. Most users agree that the log is durable enough to last large dogs who are not very aggressive during playtime.

  

At $13.99, the {{ link }} promises to be a great deal if you are looking to provide your dog with pure and utter sense of joy. Separate squeaky chipmunks can be ordered in a set of three at the price of $8.99. This means that even if you lose the originals to your dog’s excitement, you can order replacements right away.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} stands as an adorable and reliable toy for dogs. If you are a dog owner who loves their pup like anything, then this particular item will be a great fit for your household. With the holidays just around the corner, it makes for a great item to give to your little or giant furball as a gift of their own.
