With the most recent effects of climate change on Earth, more and more people are leaning towards believing the science behind this phenomenon. Those who were once climate change deniers are now slowly changing their minds and those who always believed the science are doing what they can to raise awareness about this topic. From young activists to global superstars, anyone who cares about the planet is going out of their way to talk about climate change.

  

But Greta Thunberg, Al Gore, and Leonardo DiCaprio aren’t the only individuals who are interested in preventing or mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. Fascinating companies such as {{ sn-link }} are also doing their part to create products that are great for consumers and the environment alike.

  

At first glance, the {{ link }} looks like an ordinary notebook. But please do not be fooled by the traditional look of this very modern and technology-oriented invention. This notebook is a dotted grid, eco-friendly version of a notebook that comes with one pilot frixion pen and is anything but traditional. Why? Because you can use and reuse this notebook for quite some time.

  

The {{ link }} is an environmentally friendly way to write conventionally, but without contributing to paper waste. The notebook comes with 80 dotted pages and can be used for writing, scribbling, or doodling. When you are done with the book, you can simply erase your writing and reuse the notebook that gets good as new after each erasing instance. Users have noted that this reusability serves as the greatest feature of the notebook and helps them make sure that they are doing their part in preventing the effects of climate change.

  

But how?

  

After you write in the notebook with the frixion pen and have no need for the writings, simply take the notebook and place it in your microwave. That’s right. Put it into your microwave and watch the magic happen. When you take the notebook out of your microwave, you will find out that you have a clean slate to work with. You can reheat the notebook at least 10 times. This means that you can use 80 pages x 10. Write, re-write, and keep moving on. Pretty cool right?

  

But erasing your writings doesn’t mean that you have to bid farewell to them forever. The notebook gives you the option to save your notes in the cloud. This way, you can save your content online and always have it in your Google Drive, your Dropbox, Evernote, Box, OneNote, Slack, iCloud, and even email. This means that you have the best of both worlds by having that regular intuitive feeling of writing on paper while enjoying the efficiencies of cloud for storage. To make this feature accessible, the notebook comes with its own {{ sn-link }} iOS and Android app, which makes it easier to save, archive, search and access previous notes.

  

According to users, the {{ link }} is very easy to set up and use right from the start. When you are using the notebook for the first time, you can create a free account. You can then connect your notes to your email and specific destinations such as Google Drive and Slack. This allows you to save your notes online without any complicated steps.

  

Even microwaving the book is as simple as it sounds. When you want to microwave your notebook and erase your writings, you can use a coffee mug with water in it. Take the notebook, lay it flat on the microwave dish and then place a mug on top of that center circle on the wave notebook. Users note that it is essential to microwave the notebook until the blue rocket logo inside the white circle disappears. You can simply stop when that happens, only to flip the notebook over and do the same thing with the other side. Check every thirty seconds to make sure you take it out at the right time. That’s it. It’s a fun and interactive way to reusing a notebook you have been writing in for days.

  
  

The {{ link }} comes in a simple, clean and modern package that comes with a matte finish. It is also available in two different sizes. The standard size stands at 8.5" x 9.5”, while the executive size is pegged at 6”x8.8”. Both sizes are available with or without a pen station to help you secure your pen and attach it to your notebook. The executive version also comes with erasable gel pens. Users have noted that you should use Frixion Colors marker pens for best results. You can find them on Amazon where they usually come in packs of three.

  

The best part about the notebook is not only its innovative way of giving you a reusable notebook to scribble on. It’s the price tag that it carries which makes it such a sought after product. You don’t have to pay an arm and a leg for this reusable smart invention. It will just run you around $27 to enjoy the standard edition with no pen station. That is not a bad price depending on how long it will last.

  

Durability is a key concern with an innovative and interesting product such as the {{ link }}. Some users have commented that its durability varies upon the users’ handling. For instance, many users who are college students have noted that they saw the notebook slowly fall apart after three semesters. With that being said, most users have noted that the product fulfills its promise of being long-lasting.

  

Another concern noted by users is the shadow left behind by previous writing. Some users have commented that the notebook gives them 6-7 clear uses with gentle pen pressure, after which they can see some shadow of previous writing until the final, 10th erasing session. But this also remains a concern that’s very limited to a few users.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} is quite great if you are looking for an environmentally friendly way to write. It is also a great alternative to drawing on tablets in case you are one to create rough sketches or doodles from time to time. With the cloud-save and smart search features, the notebook also makes for a great choice as a holiday gift.

  

All in all, if you or a loved one enjoy tech gadgets with a mix of nostalgia, then this notebook might be the perfect purchase for you.
